[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods. (Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two.]

WAYMAR ROYCE: What dyou expect? Theyre savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, theyre ripping each other to pieces.

WILL: Ive never seen wildlings do a thing like this. Ive never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.

WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?

WILL: Close as any man would.

GARED: We should head back to the wall.

ROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?

GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They wont trouble us no more.

ROYCE: You dont think hell ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.

[GARED grumbles.]

WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.

ROYCE: Its a good thing were not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter  If I dont catch you first. Get back on your horse. I wont say it again.

[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]

ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.

WILL: They were here.

GARED: See where they went.

[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]

ROYCE: What is it?

GARED: Its 

[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns  its the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs.
GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GAREDS head to him.]

[Blackout / Opening credits]

[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRANS shoulder.]

JON: Go on. Fathers watching.

[We see NED and CATELYN STARK watching from above.]

JON: And your mother.

[Scene shifts to needlework practice with the girls inside the castle.]

SEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA): Fine work, as always. Well done.

SANSA: Thank you.

SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that youve managed to get in this corners.  Quite beautiful  the stitching 

[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]
[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]

NED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.

JON: Dont think too much, Bran.

ROBB: Relax your bow arm.

[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]

JON/ROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!

[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]

CASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. Theyve captured a deserter from the Nights Watch.

[NED grimaces.]

NED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.

[THEON departs.]

CATELYN: Do you have to?

NED: He swore an oath, Cat.

CASSEL: The law is law, my lady.

NED: Tell Bran hes coming, too.

[CASSEL nods and departs.]

CATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.

NED: He wont be a boy forever. And winter is coming.

[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]

ROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.

[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.]

WILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.

[He and NED face each other.]

WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know Im a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them Im no coward. Tell them Im sorry.

NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.]

WILL (whispering): Forgive me, lord.

[NED bows his head over ICE.]

NED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name 

JON (to BRAN): Dont look away.

NED: King of the Andals and the First Men 

JON: Father will know if you do.

NED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.

[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]

JON: You did well.

[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]

NED: You understand why I did it?

BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.

NED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?

BRAN: Our way is the old way?

NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?

NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.

BRAN: So he was lying?

NED: A madman sees what he sees.

[Scene shifts to a dead stags head. The Winterfell men gather on the bridge They see a ravaged deer before them.]

JON: What is it?

THEON: Mountain lion?

NED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.

[With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]

THEON: Its a freak.

NED: Its a direwolf.

[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]

NED: Tough old beast.

[He pulls out the antlers.]

ROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.

JON: Now there are five.

[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]

JON: You want to hold it?

BRAN: Where will they go? Their mothers dead.

CASSEL: They dont belong down here.

NED: Better a quick death. They wont last without their mother.

THEON: Right. Give it here.

BRAN: NO!

ROBB (disgustedly to THEON): Put away your blade.

THEON: I take orders from your father, not you.

BRAN: Please, father!

NED: Im sorry, Bran.

JON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.

[Everyone looks at NED, BRAN with great hope.]

NED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

[BRAN cradles his pup as JON hands more pups to ROBB.]

BRAN (to JON): What about you?

JON: Im not a Stark. Get on.

[JON walks away, pauses, and hears another whimper.]

ROBB: What is it?

[JON pulls up a white wolf pup.]

THEON: The runt of the litter. That ones yours, Snow.

[Scene shifts to bells ringing at Kings Landing. In front of the Iron Throne, surrounded by druidical looking celebrants, lies the body of JON ARRYN. Up in the balcony, CERSEI watches the scene below as JAIME approaches.]

JAIME: As your brother, I feel its my duty to warn you: You worry too much. Its starting to show.

CERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.

JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] Were Lannisters. Lannisters dont act like fools.

CERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?

JAIME: But who would he tell?

CERSEI: My husband.

JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didnt know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while hes off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.

CERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.

JAIME: Thats an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.

Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. [CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]

CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

NED: You have five northern children. Youre not an outsider.

CATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.

NED: Its your gods with all the rules.

CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.

NED: Tell me.

CATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

NED: Your sister. The boy 

CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

NED: Hes coming this far North, theres only one thing hes after.

CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.

[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]

CATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrions chamber. Im told he reads all night.

MAESTER LUWIN: Im told he drinks all night.

CATELYN: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his  stature.

LUWIN: Weve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps well find out.

CATELYN: In any case, candles.

[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]

JON: Whys your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?

THEON: Its for the queen, I bet. I hear shes [sleek as a mink?]

ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.

ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. Hes never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.

[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRANs wolf pup.]

CATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!

BRAN: I saw the king! Hes got hundreds of people!

CATELYN: How many times have I told you: No climbing!

BRAN: But hes coming right now! Down our road!

CATELYN: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.

BRAN (looking down): I promise.

CATELYN: Dyou know what?

BRAN: What?

CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.

[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]

[Scene shifts to grand entry of the kings horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND. The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]

CATELYN: Wheres Arya? Sansa, wheres your sister?

[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]

NED: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYAs helm]

ARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!

[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]

NED: Your Grace.

ROBERT: Youve got fat.

[NED gives ROBERT a What about you? look. They start laughing.]

ROBERT: Cat!

CATELYN: Your Grace.

ROBERT: Nine years. Why havent I seen you? Where the hell have you been?

NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.

[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]

ARYA: Wheres the Imp?

SANSA: Will you shut up?

ROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, youre a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?

ARYA: Arya.

ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. Youll be a soldier.

[JAIME removes his helm.]

ARYA: Thats Jaime Lannister. The queens twin brother.

SANSA: Would you please shut up.

[CERSEI approaches.]

NED: My queen.

CATELYN: My queen.

ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.

CERSEI: Weve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.

ROBERT: Ned.

ARYA: Wheres the Imp?

[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]

CERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.

[Scene changes to the crypt.]

NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.

ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then  Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.

NED: We both did.

ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me  You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.

NED: Aye.

ROBERT: Dont look at me like that. Not his fault I didnt listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where youre no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.

[NED kneels.]

NED: Im not worthy of the honor.

ROBERT: Im not trying to honor you. Im trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, its not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. Well join our Houses.

[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]

TYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.

ROS: Did you hear the kings in Winterfell?

TYRION: I did hear something about that.

ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

TYRION: And the other brother?

ROS: The queen has two brothers?

TYRION: Theres the pretty one. And theres the clever one.

ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.

TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.

ROS: Oh? I hear hes more than earned it. I hear hes a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.

TYRION: Clever girl.

ROS: Weve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

TYRION: Have you?

TYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.

[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]

JAIME: Dont get up.

ROS: Mlord.

TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

JAIME: Youve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.

TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.

JAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Dont leave me alone with these people.

TYRION: Im sorry, Ive begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.

JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since were short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.

[JAIME leaves.]

TYRION: Close the door!

[Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyannas tomb. Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]

ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.

NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.

ROBERT: She belonged with me.

[He touches Lyannas face.]

ROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night.

NED: Its done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.

ROBERT: Not all of them.

[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.]

VISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!

[He enters a large chamber.]

VISERYS: Daenerys! Theres our bride to be! Look  a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isnt he a gracious host?

DAENERYS: Weve been his guests for over a year and hes never asked us for anything.

VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I wont forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a womans body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You dont want to wake the dragon, do you?

DAENERYS: No.

[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]

VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.

[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]

MAID: Its too hot, my lady.

[But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]

VISERYS: Where is he?

ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.

[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]

ILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.

VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. Hes a savage, of course, but hes one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.

ILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.

[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]

VISERYS: Wheres he going?

ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.

VISERYS: But he didnt say anything. Did he like her?

ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didnt like her, wed know.

[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]

ILLYRIO: It wont be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your fathers throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.

VISERYS: When will they be married?

ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?

ILLYRIO: I wouldnt ask Khal Drogo.

VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?

ILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if Ive given offense.

VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

DAENERYS (pleadingly) I dont want to be his queen. I want to go home.

VISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?

DAENERYS: I dont know.

VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogos army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if thats what it took.

[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSAS hair.]

SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks Im ugly?

CATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

SANSA: Hes so handsome.

[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]

SANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?

CATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasnt even said yes.

SANSA: Why would he say no? Hed be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

CATELYN: Hed have to leave home. Hed have to leave me. And so would you.

SANSA: You left your home to come here. And Id be queen someday. Please make father say yes.

CATELYN: Sansa

SANSA: Please, please. Its the only thing I ever wanted.

[Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up.]

BENJEN: Is he dead yet?

JON: Uncle Benjen!

[They hug.]

BENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didnt want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why arent you at the feast?

JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

BENJEN: Well, youre always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

JON: So take me with you when you go back.

BENJEN: Jon

JON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.

BENJEN: The Wall isnt going anywhere.

JON: Im ready to swear your oath.

BENJEN: You dont understand what youd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.

JON: I dont care about that.

BENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant.  Id better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. Well talk later.

[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]

TYRION: Your uncles in the Nights Watch.

JON: Whatre you doing back there?

TYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. Ive always wanted to see the Wall.

JON: Youre Tyrion Lannister. The queens brother?

TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You  youre Ned Starks bastard, arent you?

[JON looks angry and turns away.]

TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.

JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.

JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes.

[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]

[The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him.]

BENJEN: You at a feast -- Its like a bear in a trap.

NED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?

BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.

NED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.

BENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.

NED: A wildling ambush.

BENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.

NED: Winter is coming.

[ROBB approaches.]

ROBB: Uncle Benjen.

BENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?

ROBB: Im good.

[KING ROBERT gets even more bawdy with a wench.]

CATELYN (in desperation) Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?

CERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.

[They observe SANSA.]

CATELYN: Im sure its very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.

[SANSA approaches and smiles shyly at CERSEI.]

CERSEI: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?

SANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Youre tall. Still growing?

SANSA: I think so, Your Grace.

CERSEI: And have you bled yet?

SANSA (discomfited): No, Your Grace.

CERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?

[SANSA nods yes.]

CERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.

[SANSA departs.]

CERSEI (to CATELYN]: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

CATELYN: I hear the same.

CERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldnt stay hidden up here forever.

[SANSA and JOFFREY catch each others eye. JOFFREY smiles at her and she turns to her friend.]

[JAIME and NED meet up. JAIME blocks their path.]

NED: Your pardon.

JAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope its true.

NED: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

JAIME: Im sure well have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.

NED: I dont fight in tournaments.

JAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?

NED: I dont fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I dont want him to know what I can do.

JAIME: Well said.

[ARYA flips food onto SANSAs face.]

SANSA: Arya!

[CATELYN signals a laughing ROBB to deal with the girls. He hoists up ARYA.]

ROBB: Time for bed.

[The scene shifts to after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their bed.]

NED: Im a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rats nest they call a capital.

CATELYN: I wont let him take you.

NED: The king takes what he wants. Thats why hes king.

CATELYN: Ill say, Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.

NED: How did he get so fat?

CATELYN: He only stops eating when its time for a drink.

[Theres a knock at the door.]

A VOICE: Its Maester Luwin, my lord.

NED: Send him in.

LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.

[He hands CATELYN a sealed note.]

NED: Stay.

CATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie. Whats she doing at the Eyrie? She hasnt been back there since her wedding.

[CATELYN reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then burns it.]

NED: What news?

CATELYN: Shes fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.

NED: Shes fresh widowed, Cat. She doesnt know what shes saying.

CATELYN: Lysas head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her sons life, if she wasnt certain her husband was murdered?

LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?

CATELYN: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.

LUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Starks help. Hes the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.

CATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Roberts wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a kings demand.

LUWIN: A different time. Different king.

[The scene shifts to the wild wedding celebration of KHAL DROGO and DAENERYS. Fighting and fornication. DAENERYS looks stricken at everything around her.]

VISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.

ILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.

VISERYS: When?

ILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.

VISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.

[The sex and violence intensify. Two men fight to the death over a woman each is trying to rape. KHAL DROGO watches avidly.]

ILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.

[A knight in Westerosi garb appears. KHAL DROGO greets him in Dothraki. It is JORAH MORMONT, bearing books.]

JORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

DAENERYS: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?

JORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.

[DANY is presented with a chest with three dragon eggs in it.]

ILLYRIO: Dragons eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.

DAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.

[KHAL DROGO rises and strides forward. DAENERYS follows him, looking sick with fear. The Dothraki crowd behind her as she goes. The KHAL leads her to a white mare.]

DAENERYS: Shes beautiful.  Ser Jorah, I dont know how to say thank you in Dothraki.

JORAH: There is no word for thank you in Dothraki.

[The KHAL puts DANY on her horse and mounts his.]

VISERYS: Make him happy.

[The scene shifts to the seaside at sunset. The KHAL begins to unwrap DANYs dress. She is sobbing. He touches the tears on her face.]

KHAL DROGO: No.

DAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?

KHAL DROGO: No.

DAENERYS: Is no the only word that you know?

KHAL DROGO: No.

[He takes off her gown and bends her down.]

[The scene shifts to Winterfell. Tyrion and the Hound are seated outside the day after the banquet.]

THE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?

TYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.

THE HOUND: I didnt pick you for a hunter.

TYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.

THE HOUND: Its not hunting if you pay for it.

[The king and Ned come into view.]

ROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?

NED: No, but Im still better than you.

ROBERT: I know what Im putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. Youre a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one Ive got.

NED: I hope Ill serve you well.

ROBERT: You will. And Ill make sure you dont look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, lets go kill some boar!

[The kings party rides off, NED nodding goodbye to BRAN, whose wolf pup begins sniffing at his feet.]

BRAN: Come on, you.

[BRAN begins climbing, his wolf pup crying at the bottom of the castle wall. As he nears the top, he hears a woman and man moaning. Peering in the window, he sees CERSEI and JAIME having sex. CERSEI sees BRAN.]

CERSEI: Stop. STOP.

[JAIME runs and grabs BRAN at the window.]

JAIME: Are you completely mad?

CERSEI: He saw us.

JAIME: Its all right. Its all right.

CERSEI: He saw us!

JAIME: I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, arent you? How old are you, boy?

BRAN: Ten
.
JAIME: Ten.

[JAIME looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly.]

JAIME: The things I do for love.

[He shoves BRAN out the window.]

/ BLACKOUT /
Daenerys on horseback looking at Drogo and his people.

Jorah Mormont: You need to drink, child... And eat.

Daenerys Targaryen: Isn't there anything else?

Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end It'll get easier.

Arriving at camp, Daenerys looks exhausted from riding.

Doreah: Khaleesi!
Irri: Your hands.

After Daenerys is escorted away, Jorah and Viserys are alone.

Jorah Mormont: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
Viserys Targaryen: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
Jorah Mormont: As you wish, your Grace.
Viserys Targaryen: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
Jorah Mormont: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
Viserys Targaryen: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.

Joffrey finding Tyrion asleep in the dogs pen of Winterfell.

Joffrey Baratheon: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
Tyrion Lannister: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
Joffrey Baratheon: What good will my sympathies do them?
Tyrion Lannister: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
Joffrey Baratheon: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
Tyrion Lannister: One word and I'll hit you again.
Joffrey Baratheon: I'm telling mother!
Tyrion Lannister: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
Joffrey Baratheon: You can't...
Tyrion Lannister: Do you understand?
Sandor Clegane: The Prince will remember that, little lord.
Tyrion Lannister: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...

Tyrion walks from the courtyard to the dining hall where his family is eating breakfast.

Tyrion Lannister: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
Jaime Lannister: Little brother.
Tyrion Lannister: Beloved siblings.
Myrcella Baratheon: Is Bran going to die?
Tyrion Lannister: Apparently not.
Cersei Baratheon: What do you mean?
Tyrion Lannister: The Maester says the boy may live.
Cersei Baratheon: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Tyrion Lannister: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
Cersei Baratheon: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
Tyrion Lannister: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
Jaime Lannister: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
Tyrion Lannister: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
Cersei Baratheon: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
Jaime Lannister: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
Tyrion Lannister: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
Jaime Lannister: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
Tyrion Lannister: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In Brans room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console.

Cersei Baratheon: Please.
Catelyn Stark:  I would have dressed, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
Catelyn Stark: I never knew.
Cersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
Catelyn Stark:  I am grateful..
Cersei Baratheon: Perhaps this time she'll listen.

Near the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.

Jaime Lannister: A sword for the wall?
Jon Snow: I already have one.
Jaime Lannister: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
Jon Snow: Of course I have.
Jaime Lannister:  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
Jon Snow: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Jaime Lannister: Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
Jon Snow: Soon enough.
Jaime Lannister: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.

Aryas room, packing things for her trip to Kings Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch.

Arya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
Jon Snow: It's good you've got help.
Arya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
Jon Snow:  Impressive.
Arya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
Jon Snow:  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
Arya Stark:  A present?
Jon Snow:  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.
Jon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
Arya Stark: I can be quick.
Jon Snow:  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
Arya Stark: I think so.
Jon Snow: First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
Arya Stark:  I know which end to use.
Jon Snow:  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
Arya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Jon walks into Brans room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside.

Jon Snow:  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
Catelyn Stark:  You've said it.
Jon Snow:  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
Catelyn Stark: I want you to leave.

Eddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits.

Catelyn Stark: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
Eddard Stark:  I have no choice.
Catelyn Stark: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
Eddard Stark:  You can. You must.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall.

Robb Stark: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
Jon Snow:  You Starks are hard to kill.
Robb Stark: My mother?
Jon Snow:  She was very kind.
Robb Stark: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
Jon Snow:  It was always my color.
Robb Stark: Farewell, Snow.
Jon Snow:  And you, Stark.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.

Eddard Stark: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
Jon Snow: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
Eddard Stark: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Stopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.

Robert Baratheon: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
Eddard Stark:  I've half a mind to go with you.
Robert Baratheon: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
Eddard Stark: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
Robert Baratheon: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
Eddard Stark:  I recall a few chances.
Robert Baratheon: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Eddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.
Robert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
Eddard Stark:  Wylla.
Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Eddard Stark:  Nor will I.
Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
Eddard Stark: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
Robert Baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
Eddard Stark:  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
Robert Baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
Eddard Stark: She's little more than a child.
Robert Baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
Eddard Stark:  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
Robert Baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
Eddard Stark:  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
Robert Baratheon:  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
Eddard Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
Robert Baratheon:  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
Eddard Stark: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
Robert Baratheon: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Back across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, shes clearly not enjoying it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
On their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night.

Benjen Stark: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
Tyrion Lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Jon Snow: Why do you read so much?
Tyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.
Jon Snow:  Is this a trick?
Tyrion Lannister:  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
Jon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
Jon Snow: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
Tyrion Lannister:  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
Jon Snow: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
Tyrion Lannister: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Brans bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in.

Maester Luwin: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Catelyn Stark:  Talk to Poole about it.
Maester Luwin: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
Catelyn Stark: I don't care about appointments!
Robb Stark:  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Maester Luwin: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
Robb Stark:  When was the last time you left this room?
Catelyn Stark:  I have to take care of him.
Robb Stark: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
Catelyn Stark: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
Robb Stark: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
Catelyn Stark: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolfs howling repeatedly)
Robb Stark:  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.

Assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
Catelyn Stark:  No!

The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In Daenerys tent across the Narrow Sea.

Daenerys Targaryen:  Have you ever seen a dragon?
Irri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Everywhere? Even in the east?
Irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
Jhiqui: It is known.
Doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
Daenerys Targaryen: The moon?
Doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
Irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
Jhiqui: It is known.
Daenerys Targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?

Irri leaves the tent.

Doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
Daenerys Targaryen: How old were you?
Doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Nine?!
Doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Doreah: Yes.
Daenerys Targaryen: Will it take three years?
Doreah: No.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Jon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar.

Benjen Stark: Welcome.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Catelyn is on the ground where Brans body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair.

Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin.

Catelyn Stark:  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
Maester Luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.
Catelyn Stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
Theon Greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?
Catelyn Stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Rodrick Cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
Robb Stark:  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
Theon Greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
Maester Luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
Catelyn Stark:  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
Robb Stark:  I'll ride to King's Landing.
Catelyn Stark:  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
Robb Stark:  Mother, you can't.
Catelyn Stark: I must.
Rodrick Cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
Catelyn Stark:  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Rodrick Cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
Robb Stark:  What about Bran?
Catelyn Stark:  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Back at Daenerys tent, Doreah is on top of her, teaching Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo.

Doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Daenerys Targaryen: Finish a man?
Doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
Doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
Daenerys Targaryen:  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
Doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
Daenerys Targaryen:  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to Kings Landing.

Sansa Stark:  Pardon me, Ser.
Sandor Clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
Sansa Stark:  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
Sandor Clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
Joffrey Baratheon: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
Sansa Stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.

In a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is.

Mycah: I'll get you!
Sansa Stark:  Arya!
Arya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Your sister? And who are you, boy?
Mycah: Mycah, my Lord.
Sansa Stark: He the butcher's boy.
Arya Stark: He's my friend.
Joffrey Baratheon:  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
Mycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
Mycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
Joffrey Baratheon: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
Arya Stark: Stop it!
Sansa Stark:  Arya, stay out of this.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
Sansa Stark:  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Sansa Stark: Arya!

Arya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend.

Arya Stark:  Nymeria!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Please don't.
Sansa Stark:  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
Joffrey Baratheon: Then go! Don't touch me.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.

Soldier 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.

Arya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.

Arya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!

Soldier 2: It's a direwolf.
Soldier 1: I'll check down here.
Soldier 2: I think I heard a noise.

Arya Stark:  Go!

Jory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.

Jory Cassel: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
Eddard Stark: Where is she?
Jory Cassel: She's been taken directly before the King.
Eddard Stark: Who took her?
Jory Cassel: The Lannisters found her.
Eddard Stark: Right, get back.
Jory Cassel: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
Eddard Stark: Back! Back to the inn. All back!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Now back at the Inn where everyone is staying.

Arya Stark:  I'm sorry.
Eddard Stark: Are you hurt?
Arya Stark: No.
Eddard Stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
Cersei Baratheon:  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
Cersei Baratheon: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
Arya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
Cersei Baratheon: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
Arya Stark:  That's not what happened!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
Arya Stark:  Liar!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Shut up!
Robert Baratheon: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
Eddard Stark: In bed asleep.
Cersei Baratheon: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
Robert Baratheon: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
Sansa Stark: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
Arya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!
Sansa Stark: Arya!
Eddard Stark: Stop it! That's enough of that.
Arya Stark:  Liar liar liar!
Eddard Stark: Stop! Arya!
Cersei Baratheon:  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
Robert Baratheon: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
Cersei Baratheon:  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
Robert Baratheon: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
Eddard Stark: Gladly, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon:  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
Robert Baratheon: I'd forgot the damned wolf.
Soldier: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: So be it.
Cersei Baratheon: We have another wolf.
Robert Baratheon:  As you will.
Eddard Stark: You can't mean it.
Robert Baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
Sansa Stark: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
Arya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
Sansa Stark:  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
Eddard Stark: s this your command... your Grace?
Cersei Baratheon:  Where is the beast?
Soldier: Chained up outside, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
Eddard Stark: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
Cersei Baratheon: Is this some trick?
Eddard Stark:  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.

Once outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf.

Eddard Stark: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
Sandor Clegane: He ran... Not very fast.

Eddard kills the direwolf on the Kings orders.
The King, Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at Kings Landing.

Kings Landing Guard: Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
Eddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
Jory Cassel: Yes, my Lord.
Kings Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate

Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Neds disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne.

Jaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
Eddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
Jaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
Eddard Stark:  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
Eddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
Eddard Stark:  But you just stood there and watched.
Jaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
Eddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
Jaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
Eddard Stark:  You served him well, when serving was safe.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Ned enters the small councils chamber where the others are already awaiting him.

Varys: Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark: Lord Varys.
Varys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
Eddard Stark:  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
Renly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
Petyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
Eddard Stark:  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
Petyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
Eddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
Petyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
Grand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester.
Grand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
Eddard Stark: And you served another King.
Grand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
Eddard Stark:  Without the King?
Renly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
Varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
Petyr Baelish:  We are the lords of small matters here.
Renly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
Petyr Baelish:  Mmm, how much?
Eddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?
Petyr Baelish:  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?
Eddard Stark:  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
Petyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
Eddard Stark:  How could you let this happen?
Petyr Baelish:  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
Eddard Stark:  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
Renly Baratheon: "Counting coppers," he calls it.
Eddard Stark:  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
Petyr Baelish:  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
Eddard Stark:  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
Varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.

Cersei tending to Joffreys wound.

Cersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed.
Joffrey Baratheon:  It's ugly.
Cersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
Cersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
Joffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her?
Cersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I don't want to.
Cersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
Joffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
Cersei Baratheon: How would you handle them?
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
Cersei Baratheon:  A royal army?
Joffrey Baratheon:  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?
Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
Joffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.
Cersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.
Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
Joffrey Baratheon:  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
Cersei Baratheon:  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers.

Septa Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
Arya Stark:  I'm practicing.
Sansa Stark:  Practicing for what?
Arya Stark: The Prince.
Septa Mordane: Arya, stop!
Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
Sansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend.
Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
Sansa Stark: You're an idiot.
Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
Septa Mordane: Enough!

Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.

Eddard Stark:  What's happening here?
Septa Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
Eddard Stark:  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love

Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.

Eddard Stark:  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
Sansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
Septa Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.
Eddard Stark:  It's all right. Go on.

Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane.

Eddard Stark: War was easier than daughters.

Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.

Arya Stark: Go away!
Eddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
Arya Stark:  Mine.
Eddard Stark:  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
Eddard Stark:  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.
Eddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
Eddard Stark: [laughs] That's the essence of it.
Arya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
Eddard Stark:  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
Arya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
Eddard Stark:  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
Arya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.
Eddard Stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
Arya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Eddard Stark: Well Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
Arya Stark: Winter is coming.
Eddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
Eddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
Arya Stark: I can keep it?
Eddard Stark:  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.

Brans bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.

Old Nan:  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
Bran Stark:  I hate your stories.
Old Nan:  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
Bran Stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
Old Nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds

Robb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nans story.

Robb Stark:  What are you telling him now?
Old Nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
Robb Stark:  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
Bran Stark:  Maybe we do.
Robb Stark:  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
Bran Stark:  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
Robb Stark: Don't ever say that.
Bran Stark: I'd rather be dead.

Catelyn and Rodrick arrive at Kings Landing, entering through a back entrance.

Rodrick Cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
Catelyn Stark:  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
Rodrick Cassel: My Lady.

Two guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them.

Guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
Catelyn Stark:  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
Guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
Catelyn Stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
Guard: Follow me, Lady Stark.

At Baelishs brothel.

Petyr Baelish:  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
Catelyn Stark:  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a

Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave.

Petyr Baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
Catelyn Stark:  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
Petyr Baelish:  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
Catelyn Stark:  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
Petyr Baelish: A dear friend told me.
Varys:  Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark:  Lord Varys.
Varys:  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
Catelyn Stark: How did you know I was coming?
Varys:  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
Catelyn Stark:  Do you know whose dagger this is?
Varys:  I must admit I do not.
Petyr Baelish:  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
Catelyn Stark:  Yours?
Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
Catelyn Stark: To whom?
Petyr Baelish:  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.

At Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose.

Alliser Thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?

Pyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.

Alliser Thorne: Next!

Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony.

Alliser Thorne: Next!

Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly.

Alliser Thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.

Tyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard.

Tyrion Lannister: A charming man.
Jeor Mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
Tyrion Lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
Jeor Mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
Tyrion Lannister: Good news or bad?
Jeor Mormont: Both.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Back in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers.

Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
Petyr Baelish:  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
Eddard Stark:  My wife is in Winterfell.
Petyr Baelish:  Is she?

Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.

Petyr Baelish:  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
Eddard Stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
Catelyn Stark:  Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
Petyr Baelish: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Jon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him.

Grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!
Jon Snow:  It's an improvement.
Grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
Pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
Grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?
Tyrion Lannister:  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
Rast: What do you care about our faces?
Tyrion Lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
Grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
Jon Snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
Tyrion Lannister:  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
Jon Snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
Tyrion Lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

At Baelishs brothel.

Petyr Baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
Catelyn Stark: We have proof. We have the blade.
Petyr Baelish:  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
Catelyn Stark:  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
Petyr Baelish:  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
Catelyn Stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
Petyr Baelish:  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.

In the Queens chambers.

Cersei Baratheon: How could you be so stupid?
Jaime Lannister: Calm down.
Cersei Baratheon: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
Jaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
Cersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
Jaime Lannister: Then what are you raving about?
Cersei Baratheon: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
Jaime Lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
Cersei Baratheon: And my husband?
Jaime Lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : "The War for Cersei's Cunt."

Cersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear.

Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
Jaime Lannister: Never.
Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
Jaime Lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.

In a back alley before Catelyn leaves Kings Landing.

Catelyn Stark:  I wish I could see the girls.
Eddard Stark:  It's too dangerous.
Catelyn Stark: Just for a moment.
Eddard Stark:  Until we know who our enemies are...
Catelyn Stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
Eddard Stark:  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
Cersei Baratheon: And if you find the proof?
Eddard Stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
Catelyn Stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
Eddard Stark: He still loves you.
Catelyn Stark: Does he?
Eddard Stark: Off with you.

In the Kings chambers, hes drinking and eating at a table.

Robert Baratheon:  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
Barristan Selmy: Of course, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon:  Who was it?
Barristan Selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
Robert Baratheon: How'd you do it?
Barristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.
Robert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
Lancel Lannister: It's empty, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?
Lancel Lannister: There's no more wine.
Robert Baratheon:  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
Jaime Lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
Barristan Selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
Jaime Lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
Barristan Selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
Robert Baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?
Jaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so no.
Robert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
Jaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...

Riding horseback and walking through fields.

Daenerys Targaryen: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
Daenerys Targaryen: From whom?
Jorah Mormont:  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.

Daenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.

Daenerys Targaryen: Tell them all to stop.
Jorah Mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
Daenerys Targaryen:  Until I command them otherwise.
Jorah Mormont:  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
Daenerys Targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.

Daenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.

Viserys Targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?

Viserys has his sword to Daenerys throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back.

Irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  No!
Irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
Viserys Targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
Jorah Mormont:  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
Rakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]

Jon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.

Benjen Stark:  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
Jon Snow: You're leaving?
Benjen Stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
Jon Snow:  What kind of reports?
Benjen Stark:  The kind I don't want to believe.
Jon Snow: 'm ready. I won't let you down.
Benjen Stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
Jon Snow: But I'm better than every...
Benjen Stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.

Yoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.

Yoren: A bear's balls.
Tyrion Lannister: You're joking?
Yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
Tyrion Lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?
Yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
Tyrion Lannister:  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
Yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
Tyrion Lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.

Benjen enters.

Benjen Stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
Tyrion Lannister:  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
Benjen Stark:  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
Tyrion Lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
Benjen Stark: Call me what you like.
Tyrion Lannister:  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
Benjen Stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
Tyrion Lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
Benjen Stark:  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
Yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
Benjen Stark:  Enjoy the capital, brother.
Yoren: I always do.
Tyrion Lannister: I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
Yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
Tyrion Lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
Tyrion Lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
Yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
Tyrion Lannister:  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.

Irri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys breast.

Irri: Yes, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  What are you doing?
Irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. Its a blessing from the Great Stallion.

Jorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.

Jorah Mormont:  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
Rakharo: Dothraki dont wear steel dresses.
Jorah Mormont: Armor.
Rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
Jorah Mormont:  Slow.
Rakharo: Slow.
Jorah Mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
Rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
Jorah Mormont:  Ive heard that your father was a famous warrior.
Rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
Jorah Mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
Irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
Rakharo: There are no rabbits.
Irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
Rakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
Irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
Jorah Mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
Irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
Rakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
Irri: She does not want to eat horse.
Jorah Mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
Rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
Jorah Mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.

Back again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them.

Jon Snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.

Tyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.

Maester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
Tyrion Lannister:  Eight... no, nine.
Maester Aemon: All of them brief?
Tyrion Lannister:  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
Maester Aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
Jeor Mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
Tyrion Lannister:  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
Jeor Mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
Maester Aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
Jeor Mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
Maester Aemon: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.

The Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight. Daenerys surprises Drogo and speaks Dothraki to him.

Daenerys Targaryen:  Its a boy.
Khal Drogo: How do you know?
Daenerys Targaryen: I know.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Tyrion is pissing off of the wall, when hes done, Jon and him converse near a fire.

Jon Snow:  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
Tyrion Lannister: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Jon Snow:  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
Tyrion Lannister:  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
Jon Snow:  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
Tyrion Lannister: Of course.
Jon Snow: He'll never walk again.
Tyrion Lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
Jon Snow: Farewell, My Lord.

Arya arrives to her dance lesson in Kings Landing.

Syrio Forel:  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
Arya Stark:  Who are you?
Syrio Forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

Syrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it.

Syrio Forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
Arya Stark:  It's too heavy.
Syrio Forel:  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
Arya Stark: What if I drop it?
Syrio Forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
Arya Stark: I'm a girl.
Syrio Forel:  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
Arya Stark:  A needle.
Syrio Forel: Ahhh Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.

Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight.

Syrio Forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.
Open to Bran Stark dreaming. He is in the courtyard of Winterfell shooting a bow as a raven flies in. As he approaches it, it flies into the crypt, continuously cawing. As Bran enters the crypt he makes direct eye contact with the raven and sees that it has three eyes. He wakes up. Theon enters just as he wakes up.

Old Nan: The little Lord's been dreaming again.
Theon Greyjoy: We have visitors.
Bran Stark: I don't want to see anyone.
Theon Greyjoy: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
Bran Stark: I don't want to go.
Theon Greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall.

Tyrion standing in front of Robb and Maester Luwin inside the Winterfell castle.

Tyrion Lannister:  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
Robb Stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
Tyrion Lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
Robb Stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
Tyrion Lannister: Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

Hodor enters carrying Bran.

Tyrion Lannister: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
Maester Luwin: He has no memory of that day.
Tyrion Lannister: Curious.
Robb Stark:  Why are you here?
Tyrion Lannister: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
Bran Stark: Kneel, Hodor.
Tyrion Lannister: Do you like to ride, Bran?
Bran Stark: Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.
Maester Luwin: The boy has lost the use of his legs.
Tyrion Lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
Bran Stark: I'm not a cripple.
Tyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
Bran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?
Tyrion Lannister:You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Robb Stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
Tyrion Lannister: I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
Robb Stark: You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Tyrion Lannister: Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.

Before Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel, Theon sees him off in the courtyard.

Theon Greyjoy: Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.
Tyrion Lannister: Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
Theon Greyjoy: He's not my master.
Tyrion Lannister: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?
Theon Greyjoy: She wasn't feeling well.
Tyrion Lannister: She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
Theon Greyjoy: My lady's whereabouts...
Tyrion Lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?
Theon Greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.
Tyrion Lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.
Theon Greyjoy: We were outnumbered 10 to one.
Tyrion Lannister: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.
Theon Greyjoy: Careful, Imp.
Tyrion Lannister: I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.

In the courtyard of Castle Black, Jon Snow is giving the group lessons in fighting. As Alliser marches in with a new recruit, Samwell Tarly.

Jon Snow: Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.
Grenn: What in seven hells is that?
Pyp: They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
Alliser Thorne: Tell them your name.
Samwell Tarly: Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.
Rast: Come to take the black pudding.
Alliser Thorne: Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.
Samwell Tarly: I yield. Please, no more.
Alliser Thorne: On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.
Jon Snow: Enough! He yielded.
Alliser Thorne: Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
Jon Snow: Are you sure you want to do this?

Alliser has the three guys attack Jon, trying to get to Sam, Jon successfully defends them all off.

Grenn: No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
Alliser Thorne: We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
Pyp: Well fought!
Grenn: Piss off.
Samwell Tarly: Did he hurt you?
Jon Snow:  I've had worse.
Samwell Tarly: You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
Jon Snow: It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.
Grenn: Why didn't you get up and fight?
Samwell Tarly: I wanted to. I just couldn't.
Grenn: Why not?
Samwell Tarly: I'm a coward. My father always says so.
Jon Snow:  The Wall's no place for cowards.
Samwell Tarly: You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
Grenn: A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
Pyp: You're too stupid to be a coward.
Grenn: You're too stupid to be a...
Pyp: Quick now, before summer's over.
Grenn: Come on here!

Daenerys and the horde have arrived to the Dothraki homeland.

Jorah Mormont: Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
Viserys Targaryen: A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
Daenerys Targaryen: These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
Viserys Targaryen: I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
Daenerys Targaryen: If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
Daenerys Targaryen: But if they did?
Jorah Mormont: King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
Daenerys Targaryen: And you know these men?
Jorah Mormont: I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.
Daenerys Targaryen: You sold slaves.
Jorah Mormont: Aye.
Daenerys Targaryen: Why?
Jorah Mormont: I had no money and an expensive wife.
Daenerys Targaryen: And where is she now?
Jorah Mormont: In another place, with another man.

Viserys is in a tub inside of a tent, being bathed by Doreah.

Doreah: Your Grace?
Viserys Targaryen: Yes, my dear?
Doreah: They call you the last dragon...
Viserys Targaryen: They do.
Doreah: You have dragon's blood in your veins?
Viserys Targaryen: It's entirely possible.
Doreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
Viserys Targaryen: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.
Doreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
Viserys Targaryen:Really? Why dragons?
Doreah: They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
Viserys Targaryen: Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
Doreah: I was not locked in. I have seen things.
Viserys Targaryen: What have you seen?
Doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
Viserys Targaryen: A pirate ship?
Doreah: A dragon.
Viserys Targaryen: No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen : their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.
Doreah: What happened to the skulls?
Viserys Targaryen: I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.
Doreah: That's very sad.
Viserys Targaryen: Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
Doreah: No, your Grace. To teach your sister.
Viserys Targaryen: To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.

Inside of the throne room at Kings Landing.

Septa Mordane: Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...
Sansa Stark: What if I have a girl?
Septa Mordane: Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
Sansa Stark: What if I only have girls?
Septa Mordane: I wouldn't worry about that.
Sansa Stark: Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.
Septa Mordane: Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
Sansa Stark: But what if?
Septa Mordane: If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
Sansa Stark: And everyone would hate me.
Septa Mordane: Nobody could ever hate you.
Sansa Stark: Joffrey does.
Septa Mordane: Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
Sansa Stark: Please shut up about it.
Septa Mordane: Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
Sansa Stark: Aegon the Conqueror.
Septa Mordane: And who built the Red Keep?
Sansa Stark: Maegor the Cruel.
Septa Mordane: And how many years did it take to build...
Sansa Stark: My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
Septa Mordane: They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
Sansa Stark: The Mad King.
Septa Mordane: Commonly known as the Mad King.
Sansa Stark: Why were they killed?
Septa Mordane: You should speak to your father about these matters.
Sansa Stark: I don't want to speak to my father, ever.
Septa Mordane: You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
Sansa Stark: No, I won't.

Small council meeting in Kings Landing.

Janos Slynt: It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.
Eddard Stark: The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
Janos Slynt: Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
Varys: Dreadful.
Renly Baratheon: If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
Janos Slynt: I need more men.
Eddard Stark:  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
Petyr Baelish: I will?
Eddard Stark:  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.
Janos Slynt: Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.
Eddard Stark: The sooner this is over, the better.
Varys: The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
Petyr Baelish: And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
Eddard Stark: I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?

Eddard dismisses the council, as they are all leaving, Ned stops Pycelle.

Grand Maester Pycelle: This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.
Eddard Stark:  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
Eddard Stark:  Why?
Grand Maester Pycelle: I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
Eddard Stark:  What did Jon want the night before he died?
Grand Maester Pycelle: He came inquiring after a book.
Eddard Stark:  A book? What book?
Grand Maester Pycelle: I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.
Eddard Stark: I'd like to read it.

Now in Pycelles room, he hands a book to Ned.

Grand Maester Pycelle: "The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
Eddard Stark:  "Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."
Grand Maester Pycelle: As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.
Eddard Stark:  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
Grand Maester Pycelle: He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Eddard Stark:  Jon's death...
Grand Maester Pycelle: Such a tragedy.
Eddard Stark:  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
Grand Maester Pycelle:Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: "The seed is strong," I think it was.
Eddard Stark:  "The seed is strong"? What does that mean?
Grand Maester Pycelle: The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
Eddard Stark: And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
Grand Maester Pycelle: What else could it be?
Eddard Stark:  Poison.
Grand Maester Pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
Eddard Stark:  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
Eddard Stark:  Everybody knows that.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.
Eddard Stark: I've taken enough of your time.
Grand Maester Pycelle: No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...
Eddard Stark:  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.

Ned is walking back to his chambers as he sees Arya balancing on one foot in front of a staircase.

Arya Stark: Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
Eddard Stark:  It's a hard fall down these steps.
Arya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
Eddard Stark:  Cats? Syrio says
Arya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
Eddard Stark:  He's right about that.
Arya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
Eddard Stark: He needs to get his strength back first.
Arya Stark:He wants to be a knight of the Kings Guard. He can't be one now, can he?
Eddard Stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
Arya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
Eddard Stark: You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
Arya Stark: No. That's not me.

Keeping watch on the wall, Sam joins Jon as his watch partner.

Samwell Tarly: Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
Jon Snow: Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
Samwell Tarly: No, that's all right. I'm fine.
Jon Snow: You're not. You're freezing.
Samwell Tarly: I don't like high places.
Jon Snow:  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?
Samwell Tarly: On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. "You're almost a man now," he said, "but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more." Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Jon Snow:  Yes, he is.
Samwell Tarly: I'm not going to get any better, you know?
Jon Snow:  Well You can't get any worse.

Walking through the gardens of Kings Landing.

Petyr Baelish: I hear you're reading a boring book.
Eddard Stark: Pycelle talks too much.
Petyr Baelish: He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
Eddard Stark:  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
Petyr Baelish: I promised Cat that I'd help you.
Eddard Stark:  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
Petyr Baelish: A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
Eddard Stark: Varys or the Queen?
Petyr Baelish: No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Eddard Stark:  Yes.
Petyr Baelish: The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.
Eddard Stark:  Why?
Petyr Baelish: I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
Eddard Stark: Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
Petyr Baelish: Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Preparing for the Hand of the Kings tournament, Ser Hugh is pacing out steps on the joust.

Jory Cassel: Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
Hugh of the Vale: As you can see, I'm busy.
Jory Cassel: I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.
Hugh of the Vale: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...
Jory Cassel: No "ser." I'm not a knight.
Hugh of the Vale: I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Riding on horseback through Kings Landing, Ned and Jory arrive at the armorer.

Jory Cassel: He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.
Eddard Stark:  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
Jory Cassel: You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.
Eddard Stark: Let them look.
Tobho Mott: The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
Eddard Stark:  What did Lord Arryn want?
Tobho Mott: He always came to see the boy.
Eddard Stark:  I'd like to see him as well.
Tobho Mott: As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
Eddard Stark: This is fine work.
Gendry: It's not for sale.
Tobho Mott: Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...
Gendry: I made it for me.
Tobho Mott: Forgive him, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
Gendry: He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: What kind of questions?
Gendry: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.
Eddard Stark: Your mother?
Gendry: Who she was, what she looked like.
Eddard Stark: What did you tell him?
Gendry: She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
Eddard Stark: Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
Jory Cassel: Find anything?
Eddard Stark: King Robert's bastard son.

Jaime is standing guard outside of the kings chambers. You can hear King Robert with numerous girls inside his room.

Jory Cassel: This is for the King from Lord Stark.
Jaime Lannister: Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
Jory Cassel: Three? Four?
Jaime Lannister:  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
Jory Cassel: Forgive me, my Lord...
Jaime Lannister: Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
Jory Cassel: We've met before, you know.
Jaime Lannister:  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
Jory Cassel: The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
Jaime Lannister: That's where you got your scar?
Jory Cassel: Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
Jaime Lannister:  Vicious sons of whores.
Jory Cassel: They like their bloodshed.
Jaime Lannister: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
Jory Cassel: With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
Jaime Lannister:  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Jory Cassel: Theon? He's a good lad.
Jaime Lannister:  I doubt it.
Robert Baratheon: I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
Jory Cassel: Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
Jaime Lannister: I don't serve Lord Stark.

In the mess hall at Castle Black.

Grenn: Where have you been?
Jon Snow: Watch duty. With Sam.
Pyp: Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
Jon Snow: He wasn't hungry.
Pyp: Impossible!
Jon Snow: That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
Rast: You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

All of the new recruits are sleeping. Jon, Ghost (his direwolf), Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps. Jon threatens him.

Jon Snow:  No one touches Sam.

Back in the training yard the next morning. Rast is defying Alliser and not attacking Sam.

Alliser Thorne: What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.
Grenn: Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.
Alliser Thorne: You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?

After their bath, Viserys drags Doreah by her hair through the camp and into Daenerys tent.

Viserys Targaryen: You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
Doreah: Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.
Daenerys Targaryen: Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.
Irri: Yes, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen: Why did you hit her?!
Viserys Targaryen: How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
Daenerys Targaryen: I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
Viserys Targaryen: What's this?
Daenerys Targaryen: It's a gift. I had it made for you.
Viserys Targaryen: Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
Daenerys Targaryen: Please.
Viserys Targaryen: This stinks of manure. All of it.
Daenerys Targaryen: Stop - stop it.
Viserys Targaryen: You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.
Daenerys Targaryen: You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
Viserys Targaryen: You do not talk back to me!

Viserys hit Daenerys, as he mounts her to keep hitting her, she fends him off with a chain.

Viserys Targaryen: You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
Daenerys Targaryen: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.

Inside the Castle Black mess hall, cleaning up.

Samwell Tarly: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
Jon Snow: I wouldn't doubt it.
Samwell Tarly: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Jon Snow:  Sally on the side?
Samwell Tarly:It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.
Jon Snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
Samwell Tarly:Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
Jon Snow:  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
Samwell Tarly: I find that hard to believe.
Jon Snow:  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...
Samwell Tarly:You didn't know where to put it?
Jon Snow:  I know where to put it.
Samwell Tarly:Was she... Old and ugly?
Jon Snow:  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
Samwell Tarly: What color hair?
Jon Snow: Red.
Samwell Tarly: I like red hair. And her... Her...
Jon Snow:  You don't want to know.
Samwell Tarly: That good?
Jon Snow: Better.
Samwell Tarly: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
Jon Snow:  What's my name?
Samwell Tarly: Jon Snow?
Jon Snow:  And why is my surname Snow?
Samwell Tarly: Because... You're a bastard from the north.
Jon Snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.
Samwell Tarly: So... You didn't know where to put it?
Alliser Thorne: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.
Samwell Tarly: It is a bit nippy.
Alliser Thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
Jon Snow: I build my own fires.
Alliser Thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.

Inside Daenerys tent, speaking privately to Jorah.

Daenerys Targaryen: I hit him. I hit the dragon.
Jorah Mormont: Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
Daenerys Targaryen: He is still the true King.
Jorah Mormont: The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
Daenerys Targaryen: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
Jorah Mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.
Daenerys Targaryen:What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
Jorah Mormont: Home.
Daenerys Targaryen: I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.

At the Hand of the Kings tournament. Baelish sees Sansa looking at Joffrey who hides his face from her.

Petyr Baelish: Lover's quarrel?
Sansa Stark: I'm sorry. Do I...?
Septa Mordane: Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...
Petyr Baelish: An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
Arya Stark: Why do they call you Littlefinger?
Sansa Stark: Arya!
Septa Mordane: Don't be rude!
Petyr Baelish: No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
Robert Baratheon: I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!

The competitors step forward on their horses, Baelish introduces them to Sansa.

Sansa Stark: Gods, who is that?
Petyr Baelish: Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
Sansa Stark: And his opponent?
Petyr Baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
Robert Baratheon: Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!

The joust begins. The first pass takes its course with no contact. On the second pass, the Mountains joust strikes Ser Hugh in the neck, causing a massive splinter, and his blood gushing out. This occurs directly in front of where Sansa is sitting.

Petyr Baelish: Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.
Sansa Stark: I won't tell anyone. I promise.
Petyr Baelish: No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.

In Eddards quarters, Cersei enters.

Jory Cassel: My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.
Eddard Stark: Your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: You're missing your tournament.
Eddard Stark: Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
Cersei Baratheon: I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us  the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
Eddard Stark:  She likes it here.
Cersei Baratheon: The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
Eddard Stark: What are you doing here?
Cersei Baratheon:  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
Eddard Stark:  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
Cersei Baratheon: You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
Eddard Stark:  If that's my job, then so be it.
Cersei Baratheon: You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
Eddard Stark:  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: As was I.

At an inn along the Kings Road. Catelyn is heading back towards Winterfell.

Marillion: Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
Catelyn Stark: And to you.
Rodrick Cassel: Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.
Marillion: Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?
Rodrick Cassel: I'd rather throw myself down a well.
Marillion: Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!

Tyrion and Yoren of the Nights Watch enter the inn. Catelyn attempts to hide herself.

Masha Heddle: I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.
Tyrion Lannister: My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.
Masha Heddle: Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
Tyrion Lannister: Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
Bronn: You can have my room.
Tyrion Lannister: There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
Yoren: Aye, my Lord.
Marillion: My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
Tyrion Lannister: Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Masha Heddle: Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark: I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
Knight of House Whent: It is, my Lady.
Catelyn Stark: And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
Knight of House Whent: She is.
Catelyn Stark: The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
Knight of House Bracken: Our lord is honored by his trust.
Tyrion Lannister: I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
Catelyn Stark:Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.
Catelyn Stark: This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.

All of the knights draw their swords towards Tyrion.
King's Landing, Ned Stark arrives at the grounds where the Tourney of the Hand will take place. He enters a tent where Ser Hugh (deceased) is being tended to, he enters to speak with Barristan.

Eddard Stark: Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
Barristan Selmy: No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
Eddard Stark: He'd never worn this armor before.
Barristan Selmy: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
Eddard Stark: Who determines the draw?
Barristan Selmy: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.

Ned and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking.

Barristan Selmy: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
Eddard Stark: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
Barristan Selmy: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
Eddard Stark: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
Barristan Selmy: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
Eddard Stark: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
Barristan Selmy: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
Eddard Stark: Yes. That will never happen.
Barristan Selmy: Robert tends to do what he wants.
Eddard Stark: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

Ned separates from Barristan and enters King Roberts tent. Lancel, Roberts squire, is attempting to dress him in his armor.

Lancel Lannister: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
Robert Baratheon: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
Eddard Stark: You're too fat for your armor.
Robert Baratheon: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?

Both Robert and Ned begin laughing. Lancel also starts to laugh.

Robert Baratheon: Oh, its funny, is it?
Lancel Lannister: No, Your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
Eddard Stark: You're torturing the poor boy.
Robert Baratheon: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!

Lancel runs out of the tent.

Eddard Stark: The breastplate stretcher?
Robert Baratheon: How long before he figures it out?
Eddard Stark: Maybe you should have one invented.
Robert Baratheon: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
Eddard Stark: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
Robert Baratheon: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
Eddard Stark: And who's going to hit you back?
Robert Baratheon: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
Eddard Stark:There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
Robert Baratheon: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
Eddard Stark: Aye.
Robert Baratheon:  Drink.
Eddard Stark: I'm not thirsty.
Robert Baratheon: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
Eddard Stark: Your squire... A Lannister boy?
Robert Baratheon: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
Eddard Stark: Robert?
Robert Baratheon: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Now at the jousting track where there are lots of onlookers, cheering. Ser Gregor bows before the King before he and his horse take off down one lane of the track.

Eddard Stark: Where's Arya
Sansa Stark: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
Sansa Stark: Thank you, Ser Loras.

After bowing to Sansa, Loras exchanges looks with Renly Baratheon. Loras then rides and bows before the King, also taking off down the opposite track.

Sansa Stark: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Eddard Stark: Hey.
Sansa Stark: I can't watch.

Behind Ned and Sansa.

Petyr Baelish: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
Renly Baratheon: I'll take that bet.
Petyr Baelish: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
Renly Baratheon: Or you could even buy a friend.
Sansa Stark: He's going to die.
Eddard Stark: Ser Loras rides well.

A trumpet is heard and both competitors race down their lanes. Loras knocks Ser Gregor off of his mount.

Renly Baratheon: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
Petyr Baelish: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
Petyr Baelish: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
Sansa Stark: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
Petyr Baelish: No honor but quite a bit of gold.

Gregor gets up off of the ground, shouts for his sword. His squire brings it to him and then Gregor severs his horses head completely off. The crowd is stunned, Gregor then attacks Loras. Knocking him off of his horse and striking him with his sword. Sandor, the Hound, runs down from the stands and fends off his brother.

Robert Baratheon: Stop this madness in the name of your King!

Sandor takes a bow and Gregor storms off. Loras walks up to Sandor, raising his hand in victory.

Loras Tyrell: I owe you my life, Ser.
Sandor Clegane: I'm no Ser.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Stopping for rest, presumed on the Kingsroad on their way to Winterfell.

Catelyn Stark: Remove his hood.
Marillion: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)
Tyrion Lannister: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
Catelyn Stark: I did... often and loudly.
Tyrion Lannister: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
Catelyn Stark: And why would I do that?
Tyrion Lannister: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
Catelyn Stark: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Tyrion Lannister: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
Catelyn Stark: Five years ago.
Tyrion Lannister: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.
Catelyn Stark: I am not a murderer, Lannister.
Tyrion Lannister: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
Catelyn Stark: The dagger found
Tyrion Lannister: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Rodrik Cassel: Should I gag him?
Tyrion Lannister: Why? Am I starting to make sense?
Rodrik Cassel: My Lady, this way.

A rock slams into one of Catelyns men, a hill tribe begins to attack. Rodrik moves Catelyn behind a rock, out of harms way. The men, mainly Bronn begin successfully defending against the tribe. Tyrion sees Catelyn pull out a small dagger, he runs over to her and convinces her to cut him loose.

Tyrion Lannister: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?

Tyrion, now loose, runs over and picks up a shield. He fends off an attack as another of Lady Starks men kills him. Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn, Tyrion rushes over with his shield, knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat, directly in front of, and in defense of Catelyn. The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated.

Catelyn Stark: Rodrik?
Rodrik Cassel: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
Bronn:  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
Tyrion Lannister: Well, I'm willing if she is.

Back at Winterfell, Maester Luwin and Bran are at a small table, Luwin trying to teach Bran. Bran is fixed on watching Theon as he is practicing his archery.

Maester Luwin: Bran...
Bran Stark: The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - "We do not sow".
Maester Luwin: Lords?
Bran Stark: The Greyjoys.
Theon Greyjoy: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
Maester Luwin: And failed rebellions.
Bran Stark: Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
Maester Luwin: Good.
Bran Stark: Words - "Ours is the fury". Lords - the Baratheons.
Maester Luwin:: Mhmm.
Bran Stark: The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
Maester Luwin: Hmm...
Bran Stark: Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
Maester Luwin: No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
Bran Stark: Lords - the Lannisters.
Maester Luwin: We're still on their words.
Bran Stark: I don't know them.
Maester Luwin: You do know them. Think.
Bran Stark: "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
Maester Luwin:That's House Martell.
Bran Stark: "Righteous in wrath".
Maester Luwin: House Hornwood.
Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor".
Maester Luwin:Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?
Maester Luwin:You know it is.
Bran Stark: Family comes first?
Maester Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
Bran Stark: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
Maester Luwin: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
Bran Stark: And then she left!
Maester Luwin: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
Bran Stark: Why did she leave?
Maester Luwin: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
Bran Stark: Do you know where she is now? Today?
Maester Luwin:No, I don't.
Bran Stark: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
Maester Luwin: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
Bran Stark: I'll never shoot another arrow.
Maester Luwin: And where is that written?
Bran Stark: You need legs to work a bow.
Maester Luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
Bran Stark: Really?
Maester Luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Now in Theons quarters inside Winterfell, hes making love to Ros.

Theon Greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.

They break.

Ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
Theon Greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.
Ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
Theon Greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
Ros: Jealous?
Theon Greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?
Theon Greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
Ros: Might surprise you.
Theon Greyjoy: Hmm?
Ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
Theon Greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
Ros: You are jealous.
Theon Greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
Ros: And what about the Starks?
Theon Greyjoy: Ive been Lord Starks ward since I was eight years old.
Ros: A ward, thats a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again

Theon grabs Ros neck from behind.

Theon Greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
Ros: Youre a very serious boy.
Theon Greyjoy: Im not a boy.
Ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.
Theon Greyjoy: I dont want to pay for it.
Ros: Then get yourself a wife.

Arya, at Kings Landing is running through the halls chasing a cat. Shes seen running down a hallway.

Arya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.

Ned is in his chambers at his desk, Varys is speaking to him, walking around securing all of the windows before sitting down to talk more seriously.

Varys: How is your son, my Lord?
Eddard Stark: He'll never walk again.
Varys: But his mind is sound?
Eddard Stark: So they say.
Varys:A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
Varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.
Eddard Stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
Varys: I didn't trust you.
Eddard Stark: So why do you trust me now?
Varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
Eddard Stark: What sort of doom does the King face?
Varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
Eddard Stark: Who gave it to him?
Varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
Eddard Stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?
Varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
Eddard Stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
Varys: Someone who could afford it.
Eddard Stark: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
Varys: He started asking questions.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We shift to a dark dungeon of Kings Landing. Arya is still chasing the cat. She stops to admire a large dragons skull. She hears two men talking, and hides from them, just in earshot. The two men are Lord Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis.

Varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
Illyrio Mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
Varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
Illyrio Mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
Varys: This Hand is not the other.
Illyrio Mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
Varys: "Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
Illyrio Mopatis: It never was.

The two men leave, Varys locks a gate behind them. Arya runs to the gate and cant get out. She takes off in the other direction, deeper into the dungeon, to find an exit.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Varys enters the Throne Room, where Baelish is standing, looking at the throne.

Varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
Petyr Baelish: You do move quietly.
Varys: We all have our qualities.
Petyr Baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
Varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
Petyr Baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
Varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
Petyr Baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.
Varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
Petyr Baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
Varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
Petyr Baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
Varys: Strictly speaking.
Petyr Baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
Varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
Petyr Baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
Varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
Petyr Baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?
Varys: Eyes I own.
Petyr Baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
Varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
Petyr Baelish: One shudders at the thought.
Varys: Oh.
Petyr Baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
Varys: Have you?
Petyr Baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
Varys: Was that you under the bed?
Petyr Baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.
Varys: Oh, please.
Petyr Baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --

Renly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off.

Renly Baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
Petyr Baelish: To a small council meeting?
Varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Arya exits a tunnel outside of Kings Landing, at the beach of Blackwater Bay. She heads to the citys gate but is stopped by two guards.

Guard 1: Off with you. No begging.
Arya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
Guard 1: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
Arya Stark: I want to see my father.
Guard 2: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
Guard 1: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
Arya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?

Quick cut to Arya standing in front of Ned at his desk.

Eddard Stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
Arya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.
Eddard Stark: Who did?
Arya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
Eddard Stark: Oh, Arya.
Arya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
Eddard Stark: Where did you hear this?
Arya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
Eddard Stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?
Arya Stark: Chasing a cat.

A knock at the door, Jory pokes his head in.

Jory Cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
Eddard Stark: Your name, friend?
Yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
Arya Stark: I'm a girl!
Eddard Stark: Did Benjen send you?
Yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
Eddard Stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
Yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
Eddard Stark: Know what?
Yoren: Best said in private, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.
Eddard Stark: Jory, take her safely to her room.
Jory Cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.

Jory escorts Arya to her room.

Arya Stark: How many guards does my father have?
Jory Cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
Arya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
Jory Cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady.

Ned and Yoren are now alone in Neds chambers.

Eddard Stark: Well?
Yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

As Catelyn, Tyrion and her men are arriving to the Vale, theyre met by a group of guards.

Vardis Egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark: To whom do I speak?
Vardis Egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
Catelyn Stark: There was no time to send word.
Vardis Egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
Catelyn Stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
Vardis Egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
Catelyn Stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.
Vardis Egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that.

The guards all turn their horses and escort Catelyn and her men towards the Eyrie.

Tyrion Lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
Bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
Tyrion Lannister: I like you.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Ned is walking through a courtyard at Kings Landing, heading for the King Roberts chambers. He is stopped by a royal steward.

Steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
Eddard Stark: I need to see the King first -- alone.
Steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.
Eddard Stark: Is it about my wife?
Steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

Now at the small council meeting with everyone on the council, as well as King Robert.

Robert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.
Eddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.
Robert Baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
Eddard Stark: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
Robert Baratheon: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!
Eddard Stark: Then we're no better than the Mad King.
Robert Baratheon: Careful, Ned. Careful now.
Eddard Stark: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
Varys: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.
Eddard Stark: Based on whose information?
Varys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
Eddard Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Petyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
Eddard Stark: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
Robert Baratheon: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army What then?
Eddard Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
Robert Baratheon: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
Varys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
Grand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
Renly Baratheon: We should have had them both killed years ago.
Petyr Baelish: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
Eddard Stark: I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
Robert Baratheon: She dies.
Eddard Stark: I will have no part in it.
Robert Baratheon: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.

Ned removes his badge and places it on the table in front of Robert.

Eddard Stark: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
Robert Baratheon: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!

Ned is in his chambers quickly packing his things.

Eddard Stark: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
Jory Cassel: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
Petyr Baelish: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
Eddard Stark: What can I do for you?
Petyr Baelish: When do you return to Winterfell?
Eddard Stark: Why? What do you care?
Petyr Baelish: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
Eddard Stark: I don't have the time.
Petyr Baelish: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.

Baelish exits Neds chambers, Ned speaks to Jory briefly and then takes off for Baelish.

Eddard Stark: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
Jory Cassel: Heward and Wyl.
Eddard Stark: Find them and meet me at the stables.

At the Eyrie, Catelyn, her men, and Tyrion are all standing in front of Lady Arryn. Her son is sitting on her lap, breastfeeding. He is clearly too old to be doing so.

Lysa Arryn: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
Catelyn Stark: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-
Lysa Arryn: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
Robin Arryn: Mommy? Is that the bad man?
Lysa Arryn: It is.
Robin Arryn: He's little.
Lysa Arryn: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
Tyrion Lannister: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
Lysa Arryn: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
Tyrion Lannister: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
Robin Arryn: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
Lysa Arryn: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
Robin Arryn: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
Lysa Arryn: Perhaps you will, my little love.
Catelyn Stark: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.

Mord throws Tyrion into a skycell.

Mord: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!

Back at Kings Landing, inside Renly Baratheons chambers. He is sitting, shirtless, with Loras Tyrell kneeling beside him shaving his chest. Loras is also shirtless.

Loras Tyrell: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
Renly Baratheon: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
Loras Tyrell: You're jealous.
Renly Baratheon: Are you sure this won't hurt?
Loras Tyrell: Only if I slip.
Renly Baratheon: And you prefer me like this?
Loras Tyrell: Mhmm.
Renly Baratheon: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
Loras Tyrell: I want you.
Renly Baratheon: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
Loras Tyrell: Hold still.
Renly Baratheon: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
Loras Tyrell: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mle.
Renly Baratheon:His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
Loras Tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the mle if he didn't know how to fight.
Renly Baratheon: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
Loras Tyrell: It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
Renly Baratheon: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
Loras Tyrell: Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

Finished with Renlys chest, Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit.

Renly Baratheon: Everywhere?
Loras Tyrell: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
Renly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
Loras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
Renly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
Loras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.
Renly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.
Loras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.
Renly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
Loras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?
Renly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
Loras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?
Renly Baratheon: Be serious.
Loras Tyrell: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
Renly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.
Loras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
Renly Baratheon: Stannis?
Loras Tyrell: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
Renly Baratheon: He's still my older brother.

Loras cuts Renly under his arm.

Renly Baratheon: What are you doing?!
Loras Tyrell: Look at it.
Renly Baratheon: You cut me!
Loras Tyrell: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.
Loras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Cersei enters King Roberts chambers.

Cersei Baratheon: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
Robert Baratheon: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
Cersei Baratheon: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
Robert Baratheon: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
Cersei Baratheon: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
Robert Baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.
Cersei Baratheon: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
Robert Baratheon: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
Cersei Baratheon: Is my father wrong?
Robert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
Cersei Baratheon: We still outnumber them.
Robert Baratheon: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
Cersei Baratheon: Five.
Robert Baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
Cersei Baratheon: What do you want?
Robert Baratheon: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
Cersei Baratheon: Our marriage.

The two begin laughing.

Robert Baratheon: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
Cersei Baratheon: Every day.
Robert Baratheon: How long can hate hold a thing together?
Cersei Baratheon: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
Robert Baratheon: Yes, it is.
Cersei Baratheon: Yes, it tis. What was she like?
Robert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
Cersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
Robert Baratheon: So why now?
Cersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
Robert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
Cersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?
Robert Baratheon: I know.
Cersei Baratheon: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?
Robert Baratheon: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
Cersei Baratheon: It doesn't make me feel anything.

Inside one of Baelishs brothels, Ned is speaking to one of the prostitutes. Jory and Baelish are in the next room.

Mhaegen: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
Eddard Stark: Aye.
Mhaegen: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.
Eddard Stark: I will.
Mhaegen: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
Eddard Stark: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
Mhaegen: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
Eddard Stark: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.

Ned breaks off from Mhaegen and enters the same room as Baelish and Jory.

Petyr Baelish: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
Eddard Stark: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
Petyr Baelish: Well, he has more than you, for a start.
Eddard Stark: How many?
Petyr Baelish: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
Eddard Stark: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
Petyr Baelish: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
Eddard Stark: Come.

Jory is staring at one of the whores, who flashes him her breast.

Eddard Stark: Jory!
Jory Cassel: My Lord.

Ned and Jory leave the brothel with a few of Neds men. They are suddenly surround by Jaime Lannister and his men.

Jaime Lannister: Such a small pack of wolves.
Jory Cassel: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
Jaime Lannister: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
Petyr Baelish: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
Jaime Lannister: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
Eddard Stark: I remember him well.
Jaime Lannister: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
Eddard Stark:He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.

Jaime draws his sword, causing all of them men on both sides to draw their swords, except for Eddard.

Petyr Baelish: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
Jaime Lannister: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
Jory Cassel: If you threaten my Lord again...
Jaime Lannister: Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of?
Eddard Stark: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
Jaime Lannister: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!

A fight erupts, first Jaimes men throw spears straight into the chests of two of Neds men. Ned draws his sword and moves towards Jaime, fending off several guards in the process. Jory gets to Jaime first. Jaime stabs Jory with a dagger straight through his eye. The fighting ceases and Ned moves forward to Jaime, Jaimes men all stop to watch the fight. The two fend each other off, as they break, one of Jaimes guards stabs Ned in the back of the leg with a spear, causing him to fall to the ground. Jaime is openly frustrated and knocks the guard out. He mounts his horse.

Jaime Lannister: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.

Jaime rides off on horseback and his guards follow suit.
Opens at Kings Landing, assumed to be Neds quarters. He opens his eyes to find Cersei and King Robert at his bedside.

Eddard Stark:  Your pardon, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: Do you know what your wife has done?
Eddard Stark:  She did nothing I did not command.
Robert Baratheon: Whod have thought she had it in her?
Cersei Baratheon: By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
Eddard Stark:  I am the Kings Hand -
Cersei Baratheon: You were the Kings Hand!
Eddard Stark:  - trying to keep the peace -
Cersei Baratheon: You shall now be held accountable.
Robert Baratheon: Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and youll make your peace with Jaime.
Eddard Stark: He butchered my men.
Cersei Baratheon: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman.
Eddard Stark:  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
Cersei Baratheon: I took you for a king.
Robert Baratheon: Hold your tongue.
Cersei Baratheon: Hes attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.

Robert smacks Cersei.

Cersei Baratheon: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
Robert Baratheon: Wear it in silence or Ill honor you again.

Cersei exits the room, slamming the door shut behind her.

Robert Baratheon: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not That was not kingly.
Eddard Stark:  If we dont act there will be a war.
Robert Baratheon: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to Kings Landing. Shes had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
Eddard Stark:  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
Robert Baratheon: Im half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I dont know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I dont want to know. This is what matters - I cant rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each others throats, so enough!
Eddard Stark:  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
Robert Baratheon: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. Im the king, I get what I want I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but its true. You were the brother I chose. Well talk when I return from the hunt.

Robert throws the Hand of the Kings badge onto the bed where Ned is laying.

Eddard Stark: The hunt?
Robert Baratheon: Killing things clears my head. Youll have to sit on the throne while Im away. Youll hate it more than I do.
Eddard Stark: The Targaryen girl -
Robert Baratheon: Seven hells! Dont start with her again! The girl will die and Ill hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother Ill pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.

Robert exits the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Ned picks up the badge and looks at it.

Back at Vaes Dothrak across the sea, Daenerys is holding one of her prized dragon eggs. She looks up at a pot of coals inside of her tent. She walks over and places the egg into the coals. Irri walks into the tent.

Irri: Khaleesi?

Daenerys picks up the egg from the coals.

Irri: Oh, Khaleesi!

Irri takes the egg from her hands, dropping it instantly because of the heat. She looks at Daenerys hands and there are no burn marks. The two compare hands, Irris have burn marks.

Daenerys Targaryen: Youre hurt.

A raven caws. Bran is shooting his bow in the courtyard. The raven flies to the crypts of Winterfell, Bran follows. As he enters, again making eye contact with the bird. The raven flies deeper into the crypts. We then see Bran sleeping in his bed, showing that this was another vision, we hear footsteps running towards his door. His door swings opens and Bran sits up in bed breathing heavily. Hodor is carrying the contraption that Tyrion brought the blueprints for. Bran smiles. We then cut to the woods of Winterfell where Bran is shouting as hes riding on the back of a horse.

Robb Stark: Not too fast.
Bran Stark: Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)
Theon Greyjoy: When are you gonna tell him?
Robb Stark: Not now.
Theon Greyjoy: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
Robb Stark: Youre talking about war.
Theon Greyjoy: Im talking about justice.
Robb Stark: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
Theon Greyjoy: A Lannister put his spear through your fathers leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
Robb Stark:You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
Theon Greyjoy: Youre not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. Theyve already started the war. Its your duty to represent your House when your father cant.
Robb Stark: And its not your duty, because its not your House.

It goes silent, Bran can no longer be heard jeering at his horse. Robb looks at Theon and stands up looking through the woods.

Robb Stark: Wheres Bran?
Theon Greyjoy: I dont know. Its not my House.

Theon stands up and walks away from Robb, who begins to look around. We cut to Bran riding slowly through the woods. We see someone creeping up behind him as his horse is nickering. As Bran enters a clearing, several Wildlings surround him.

Bran Stark: Robb?
Osha: All alone in the deep dark woods.
Bran Stark: Im not alone, my brother is with me.
Wildling: I dont see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
Osha: Oh, thats a pretty pin. Silver.
Wildling: Well take the pin. And the horse. Get down Be quick about it.
Bran Stark: I cant. The saddle, the straps.
Wildling: Whats wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
Bran Stark: Im Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you dont let me be, Ill have you all killed!
Wildling 2: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
Osha: the boys worth nothing dead. Benjen Starks own blood. Think what Mance would give us.

A Wildling is cutting Brans straps to his saddle, accidentally slicing into Brans leg but he feels no pain.

Wildling: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. Were going as far south as south goes. There aint no white walkers down in Dorne.

Robb comes into view, behind the four Wildlings.

Robb Stark: Drop the knife. Let him go and Ill let you live.

One of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack. Robb counters, slicing the Wildlings throat. Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair. He fights off and kills the other Wildling. The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat, meanwhile Robb has Osha (female Wildling) and a knife to her throat.

Bran Stark: Robb!
Wildling: Shut up! Drop the blade!
Bran Stark: No, dont.
Wildling: Do it.

Robb looks at Bran and then back up at the Wildling. He then slowly sets his sword on the ground, still gripping Osha by her hair. He looks back up at the Wildling who suddenly gets an arrow through his chest from his back. As he drops to the ground bleeding, we see Theona few yards behind him with a bow. The Wildling falls dead, Theon approaches. Robb releases Osha from his grasp as Theon walks over drawing his bow on her. Robb moves over to Bran.

Robb Stark: Are you all right?
Bran Stark: Yes, it doesnt hurt.
Theon Greyjoy: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, youre not a man until youve killed your first enemy. Well done.
Robb Stark: Have you lost your mind? What if youd missed?
Theon Greyjoy: He would have killed you and cut Brans throat.
Robb Stark: You dont have the right -
Theon Greyjoy: To what, to save your brothers life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
Robb Stark: What about her?
Osha: Give me my life, my lord, and Im yours.
Robb Stark: Well keep her alive.

Osha gives a sigh of release, Theon releases his bow and Robb, holding Bran, assures that hes okay.

Now at the Eyrie, Tyrion is sleeping and rolls to his side at the very edge of his skycell. He awakes, quickly moving back to the wall. He steps over to the door to his cell and begins pounding on it.

Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!

The door swings open and Mord rushes in, batting Tyrion to the opposite side of the cell.

Mord: Dwarf man making noise!
Tyrion Lannister: How would you like to be rich?
Mord: Dwarf man still making noise.
Tyrion Lannister: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. Im prepared to give you lots of gold.

Mord quickly searches Tyrions pockets for gold.

Mord: No gold!
Tyrion Lannister: Well, I dont have it here.
Mord: No gold! Fuck off.

Mord hits Tyrion once more with his club then storms out of the cell, shutting the door behind him.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Now in a hall at Kings Landing. We see Syrio shutting a door and holding two wooden swords. He slowly steps down towards Arya and tosses her one of the swords, she seamlessly catches it as he takes his fighting stance.

Arya Stark:  I dont want to practice today.
Syrio Forel: No?
Arya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I dont care about stupid wooden swords.
Syrio Forel: You are troubled.
Arya Stark:  Yes -
Syrio Forel: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
Arya Stark: I dont like dolls and k -
Syrio Forel: Youre not here. Youre with your trouble. If youre with your trouble when fighting happens

Arya makes a move for Syrio, who quickly counters and puts her on her back.

Syrio Forel:  More trouble for you. Just so How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?
Syrio Forel: The old and the new.
Syrio Forel: There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - Not today.

Syrio steps back and tosses Arya her sword back, she catches it and assumes the counter position.

Back across the sea in Vaes Dothrak, were inside a large communal tent. Daenerys is centered around everyone and eating the heart of a horse a the Dothraki and a priest chant around her. Her husband Khal Drogo looks on in anticipation as she continues eating.

Viserys Targaryen: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasnt my horse.
Jorah Mormont: Shes doing well.
Viserys Targaryen: Shell never keep it down.

She keeps eating the heart, nearing the end. The Dothraki onlookers all chant in unison, getting louder and louder. The priestess is also chanting, louder and louder. Khal Drogo stares more intently at his wife, she stares back. The chanting grows louder, as does the priestess.

Viserys Targaryen: Tell me what she is saying.
Jorah Mormont: The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him and their wives will weep tears of blood.

The eating and chantines intensifies as Viserys looks on in shock.

Jorah Mormont: Shes going to have a boy.
Viserys Targaryen: He wont be a real Targaryen. He wont be a true dragon.

As the chanting is at its loudest, Daenerys has finished with the heart. Everyone looks on in anticipations, she wretches forward, on the verge of puking. The chanting suddenly halts. Khal Drogo leans in and looks intensly. Daenerys holds everything in and sobs. Her hands bloody, she slowly sits up, keeping everything in as she gulps the final bite. The priestess begins to speak, Jorah translates directly for Viserys.

Jora: The stallion who mounts the world. The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.

Daenerys rises to her feet, speaking in Dothraki to the room.

Daenerys Targaryen: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!

The room begins chanting, Rhaego! Rhaego! As the chanting grows louder and louder, Drogo stands up and walks up to Daenerys.

Viserys Targaryen: They love her.

The rooms chanting gets even louder. Drogo hugs his wife at her thighs and hoists her up, carrying her around the room.

Jorah Mormont: She truly is a queen today.

Jorah looks to his right towards Viserys, who has now slipped out. We cut to Daenerys tent. Inside, Viserys opens the container that holds her dragon eggs. He sighs and then puts them into a sack. Jorah walks into the tent behind him, blocking the door.

Jorah Mormont: Dont let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
Viserys Targaryen: Its not my law.
Jorah Mormont: They dont belong to you.
Viserys Targaryen: Whatever is hers is also mine.
Jorah Mormont: Once, perhaps.
Viserys Targaryen: If I sell one egg, Ill have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.
Jorah Mormont: And you have all three.
Viserys Targaryen: I need a large army Im the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You dont think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Dont think I know what you want? I dont care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
Jorah Mormont: You can go, but you cant have the eggs.
Viserys Targaryen: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
Jorah Mormont: It means everything to me.
Viserys Targaryen: And yet here you stand?
Jorah Mormont: And here I stand.

Viserys and Jorah stare at each other for a moment, before Viserys drops the sack containing the dragon eggs to the floor. Jorah steps aside, unblocking the exit. Viserys leaves.

Back at the skycell below the Eyrie. Tyrion is again shouting for Mord.

Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
Mord: Noise again!
Tyrion Lannister: About the gold -
Mord: No gold!
Tyrion Lannister: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
Mord: Where?
Tyrion Lannister: Where? I dont know where, but when they free me -
Mord: You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)
Tyrion Lannister: Have you ever heard the phrase Rich as a Lannister? Of course you have. Youre a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, a Lannister always pays his debts. If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
Mord: What message?
Tyrion Lannister: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

We cut to the throne room, where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne, at the helm of the room. Catelyn is standing next to them, as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly.

Lysa Arryn: You wish to confess your crimes?
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.
Lysa Arryn: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.
Tyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? Im a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. Im not particularly good at violence, but Im good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncles boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -
Lysa Arryn: Silence!
Robin Arryn:What happened next?!
Lysa Arryn: What do you think youre doing?
Tyrion Lannister: Confessing my crimes.
Catelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sisters husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Tyrion Lannister: Oh, Im very sorry. I dont know anything about all that.
Lysa Arryn: Youve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
Tyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the Kings Justice? Im accused and demand a trial.
Lysa Arryn: If youre tried and found guilty, then by the kings own laws you will pay with your life.
Tyrion Lannister: I understand the law.
Lysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.

Several men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room. In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well. The wells floor begins to open and wind comes howling through. Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands. Tyrion looks down and sees that its a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground, he would inevitably die if he had to go out this door.

Lysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.
Tyrion Lannister: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.

Subdued laughter fills the room, Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks.

Lysa Arryn: You have that right.
Knight 1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
Knight 2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
Knight 3: Ill fight for you, my Lady.
Knight 4: Itll be my honor.
Knight 5: The honor should be mine.
Robin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!
Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis Youre quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
Ser Vardis: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
Tyrion Lannister: Agreed.
Lysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.
Tyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
Ser Vardis: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imps champion for you.
Tyrion Lannister: I wouldnt be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

The room shudders.

Lysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
Tyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him, Im happy to wait.
Lysa Arryn: The trial will be today.
Tyrion Lannister: Do I have a volunteer?

Again, the majority of the room laughs quietly.

Tyrion Lannister: Anyone?... Anyone?
Lysa Arryn: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
Bronn: Ill stand for the dwarf.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the woods, outside of Kings Landing.

Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?
Robert Baratheon: Oh, what was I saying?
Renly Baratheon: A simpler time.
Robert Baratheon: It was! It was. Youre too young to remember. Wasnt it, Selmy?
Barriston: It was, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
Renly Baratheon: Sounds exhilarating.
Robert Baratheon: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?
Renly Baratheon: Once, I think.
Robert Baratheon: You think? I think youd remember. Back in our day, you werent a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it making the eight.
Renly Baratheon: Those were some lucky girls.
Robert Baratheon: You ever make the eight, Barristan?
Barristan Selmy: I dont believe so, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: (laughs) Those were the days!
Renly Baratheon: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
Robert Baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but youre speaking to the King.
Renly Baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and make the eight.
Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?

Renly walks off in the opposite direction of the group. Robert takes a large swig off of the wine and quickly continue walking.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the throne room of Kings Landing. Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert, as he is Hand of the King. Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left. The room is filled with people.

Man: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Brigands, most likely.
Man: They werent thieves, they didnt steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Its the Kings Hand youre addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.

A second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor. Its a pile of fish.

Petyr Baelish: Fish. The sigil of House Tully. (whispers to Ned) Isnt that your wifes House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
Eddard Stark:  These men, were they flying a sigil?  A banner.
Man: None, your Hand. The one who was leading them Taller by a foot than any man Ive ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
Petyr Baelish: (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
Eddard Stark:  Youre describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
Petyr Baelish: Ive heard him called Tywin Lannisters mad dog. Im sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
Grand Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the kings protection, it would be -
Petyr Baelish: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Wel
Eddard Stark:  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.

Beric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward.

Eddard Stark:  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregors keep.
Beric Dondarrion: As you command.

Ned stands up with the assistance of a cane. He steps forward.

Eddard Stark:  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the kings justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
Grand Maester Pycelle: My lord This This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Roberts return.
Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester Pycelle.
Grand Maester Pycelle: My Lord.
Eddard Stark:  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.

The men all bow their heads in acknowledgement. Ned steps down from the throne, Baelish follows him, speaking only to Ned.

Petyr Baelish: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lions tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
Eddard Stark: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Back at the Eyrie throne room in the Vale. The men again crank and the Moon Door is opened. Ser Vardis prepares himself with a sword, shield and full body of armor. Bronn refuses a shield and is only wearing leather clothes. Robin Arryn screams fight and the two men move forward. Multiple times Vardis swings forward and multiple times Bronn casually steps to the side, causing Vardis to waste his energy. Bronn moves backwards as Vardis continues to swing away, eventually up a staircase. Bronn hops over the staircase railing, again avoiding Vardis attacks. Lysa screams Stand and fight, coward! Bronn kicks over a candle stand in front of Vardis. Vardis steps over it and is again on the offensive, moving Bronn towards the center of the room, close to the now opened Moon Door. The men hold one another off directly in front of the door, Vardis appearing to have the edge. Robin is giggling as Tyrion looks worried. Bronn muscles Vardis blade away from him and steps to the side. Vardis yet again goes excessively offensive and swings for the fences and Bronn keeps stepping away. Vardis moves Bronn again to the middle of the room, as he swings for Bronns head, Bronn ducks and stabs Vardis in the belly. The room is in disbelief. Vardis moves forward, muscling through the pain. Bronn side-steps him a few more times and slices through his back. Vardis swings once more, but Bronn shoves his body towards the Moon Door. Bronn is in complete control as Vardis is defenseless against the door. Bronn looks up at Lysa and Robin who have blank faces - faces of shock - so he thrusts his sword into Vardis neck, killing him, and pushing him out of the Moon Door.

Robin Arryn: Is it over?
Lysa Arryn: You dont fight with honor!
Bronn: No. He did.

Tyrion turns to Mord who uncuffs him.

Robin Arryn: Can I make the little man fly now?
Tyrion Lannister: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.

Rodrik Cassel tosses Tyrion his purse. Tyrion bows before Catelyn, begins walking out, Bronn following. He tosses Mord the purse full of coins.

Tyrion Lannister: A Lannister always pays his debts.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

At Kings Landing, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane, both sowing.

Mordane: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
Sansa Stark: Well, why shouldnt I? Were in the south.
Mordane: Its important to remember where you come from. Im not sure your mother would like these new styles.
Sansa Stark: My mother isnt from the North.
Mordane: Im aware of that.
Sansa Stark: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
Mordane: Yes. I have hair.
Sansa Stark: Ive never seen it.
Mordane: Would you like to?
Sansa Stark: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?
Mordane: I come from a very small village in -
Sansa Stark: Oh, wait. I just realized I dont care.
Mordane: Sansa -
Sansa Stark: Septa.
Mordane: Now you are being rude.

A door can be heard closing. Prince Joffrey walks in. Sansas eyes light up as both women stand up.

Mordane: My prince.
Sansa Stark: My prince.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?

Joffrey offers Sansa a necklace. She turns around, for him to put it on her, as acceptance.

Sansa Stark: Its beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Youll be queen one day, its only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
Sansa Stark: Theres nothing to forgive.
Joffrey Baratheon: Youre my lady. One day well be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  Ill never disrespect you again. Ill never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? Youre my lady now, from this day, until my last day.

The two share their first kiss.

In the woods outside of Winterfell, Theon is riding his horse, alone. He comes to a road and sees a carriage leaving, Ros on the back of it riding south.

Theon Greyjoy: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
Ros: Going to Kings Landing.
Theon Greyjoy: In a turnip cart?
Ros: Ill find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
Theon Greyjoy: And you can afford that?
Ros: Some of my friends are more generous than others.
Theon Greyjoy: Theres a thousand girls like you in Kings Landing.
Ros: Ill have lots of company
Theon Greyjoy: Yes, youll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he cant get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
Ros: (laughs) And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
Theon Greyjoy: Dont be a fool.
Ros: I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of Kings Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, theres nothing more for me here. Lets go, Steffon.
Theon Greyjoy: Let me see it one more time?
Ros: See what?

The carriage is driving away from Theon, he scrambles and flips Ros a coin. She catches it and lifts up her dress one final time for Theon, while laughing.

Theon Greyjoy: Im going to miss you!
Ros: I know.

At Kings Landing in Neds quarters. Arya and Sansa await as their father limps forward, using his cane for assistance.

Eddard Stark:  Im sending you both back to Winterfell.
Sansa Stark: What?!
Eddard Stark:  Listen -
Sansa Stark: What about Joffrey?
Arya Stark:  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why youre sending us home?
Eddard Stark:  What? No.
Sansa Stark: Please, Father. Please dont.
Arya Stark:  You cant. Ive got my lessons with Syrio. Im finally getting good.
Eddard Stark:  This isnt a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
Arya Stark:  Cant we take Syrio back with us?
Sansa Stark: Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I cant go. Im supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and Im meant to be his queen and have his babies.
Arya Stark: Seven hells.
Eddard Stark:  When youre old enough, Ill make you a match with someone whos worthy of you, someone whos brave and gentle and strong -
Sansa Stark: I dont want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! Hell be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and Ill give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
Arya Stark: The lions not his sigil, idiot. Hes a stag, like his father.
Sansa Stark: He is not. Hes nothing like that old drunk king.
Eddard Stark:  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.
Sansa Stark: Wait!
Arya Stark:  Come on! (dragging Sansa)
Sansa Stark: Its not fair!

The two exit Neds room and close the door behind them. Ned slowly makes his way over to his desk, opening the book that Grand Maester Pycelle had given him earlier. The book covers the lineages of all the great Houses of Westeros. Ned turns and reviews the Baratheon page, reading out loud.

Eddard Stark:  Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair. Axel Baratheon, black of hair. Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair. Steffon Baratheon, black of hair. Robert Baratheon, black of hair. Joffrey Baratheon golden-haired.

Ned has a revelation and closes the book.

Back at Vaes Dothrak, in a very large hut. It is a celebration. A pig roasts over a center fire as there are drums being played and people dancing everywhere. Viserys stumbles in, clearly drunk.

Viserys Targaryen: Daenerys! Wheres my sister?

Daenerys and Jorah both look up, noticing her brother on the opposite side of the hut. Drogo, on another side of the hut also sees Viserys. Jorah stands up and begins walking towards Viserys.

Daenerys Targaryen: Stop him.
Viserys Targaryen: Where is she? Im here for the feast. The whores feast.
Jorah Mormont: Come.
Viserys Targaryen: Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!

A man sitting next to Drogo says something in Dothraki that makes the Khal laugh. Viserys hears this and spins around.

Viserys Targaryen: Khal Drogo! Im here for the feast.
Khal Drogo: (speaks Dothraki, motions to the other side of the hut)
Jorah Mormont: Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
Viserys Targaryen: That is no place for a king.
Khal Drogo:  You are no king.

Viserys draws his sword, Jorah moves forward, Viserys holds his sword at Jorah.

Viserys Targaryen: Keep away from me!

The drums stop and now everyone in the hut is paying attention.

Daenerys Targaryen: Viserys, please.
Viserys Targaryen: There she is.
Jorah Mormont: Put the sword down. Theyll kill us all.
Viserys Targaryen: They cant kill us. They cant shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.

The Khal is fiercely looking at the situation as Viserys has his blade to Daenerys stomach. A woman is translating for Drogo as Viserys speaks.

Viserys Targaryen: Tell him I want what was bargained for or Im taking you back. He can keep the baby. Ill cut it out and leave it for him.
Khal Drogo:  (speaks Dothraki)
Viserys Targaryen: Whats he saying?
Daenerys Targaryen: He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.
Viserys Targaryen: That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.

Viserys takes his blade away from Daenerys stomach and steps back, smiling. Drogo stands up and walks to his wife, placing his hand on her belly as they exchange looks. The Khal says something in Dothraki, two men instantly come up behind Viserys, each holding one of his arms. One man breaks Viserys right arm as he screams.

Viserys Targaryen: No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!

The two men force Viserys to the ground, still holding him by his arms. The Khal moves towards them and mutters something in Dothraki. A woman tips over a kettle that was over the fire, pouring out its contents. Drogo throws some golden jewelry into the kettle.

Jorah Mormont: Look away Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen: No.
Viserys Targaryen: No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You cant!

The golden jewelry is now melted down into liquid. Khal Drogo lifts the kettle up and walks over towards the screaming Viserys.

Viserys Targaryen: Dany please!
Khal Drogo: A crown for a king.

Khal Drogo raises the kettle over Viserys head and pours out the melted gold onto his skull. He screams as the hot liquid solidifies on his skull, the two men release Viserys, he instantly falls to the ground dead.

Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi
Daenerys Targaryen: He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.

Trumpets sounds from the Lannister camp. Going inside a tent, we see Tywin Lannister sharpening his knifes, preparing to skin a deer, while Jaime Lannister starts reading the received letter from Ned Stark.

Jaime Lannister:  "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
Uh, "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown."
Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment.
Tywin Lannister:  Attacking him was stupid.
Tywin Lannister:  Lannisters don't act like fools.
Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.
Jaime Lannister:  Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
Jaime Lannister:  Tyrion?
Tywin Lannister:  Ned Stark.
Jaime Lannister:  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
Jaime Lannister:  It wouldn't have been clean.
Tywin Lannister:  Clean...
Tywin Lannister:  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
Jaime Lannister:  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
Tywin Lannister:  Now that's what you want people to think of you.
Jaime Lannister:  It's the truth.
Tywin Lannister: When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
Jaime Lannister:  Of course it bothers me.
Tywin Lannister:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
I'm giving you half of our forces. 30,000 men.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
Jaime Lannister:  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
Tywin Lannister:  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
Jaime Lannister:  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
Tywin Lannister:  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!
If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.
Your mother's dead. Before long I'll be dead.
And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on.
Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
Do you understand?
Jaime nods gently.
Tywin Lannister:  Hmm.
You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.
And you are still blessed with youth.
And what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings.
One a madman, the other a drunk.
The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
I need you to become a man you were always meant to be.
Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now.
Submissive as he looks, Jaime walks out of the tent.
Entering King's Landing, we see Syrio Forel dancing with Arya.

Syrio Forel:  Yah! Left high, left low.
How ironic it seems, how peacefully Arya and Syrio are dancing, near the Throne room, the Kings Guard fights a few Stark men.
Going back again at Arya's dancing training.

Syrio Forel:  Right low, lunge right.

Outside in a courtyard, a few Stark stewards are packing and bringing out the Stark family's belongings.

Steward of House Stark:  If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...

The stewards are being slaughtered by the Kingsguard.
Going back inside the Red Keep, Sansa is walking down a hallway with her Septa.

Septa Mordane:  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
How she could forget...
Sansa Stark:  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning. She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Septa Mordane:  Hush! Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
Sansa Stark:  What is it? What's happening?
Septa Mordane:  Do as I told you. Run!

Back at Arya's training.

Syrio Forel:  This way! Left, right.
Rah! Now you are dead.
Arya Stark:  You said right, but you went left.
Syrio Forel:  And now you are a dead girl.
Arya Stark:  Only 'cause you lied.
Syrio Forel:  My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
Arya Stark:  I was so. I watched, but you...
Syrio Forel:  Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
The Kingsguard approaches.
Meryn Trant:  Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
Syrio Forel:  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
Meryn Trant:  Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
Arya Stark:  My father wouldn't send you.
As she picks up her wooden stick from the ground, she says.
Arya Stark:  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Maryn Trant:  Take her.
Syrio Forel:  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Kings guard:  Get out of my way, little man.
Syrio Forel:  I am Syrio Forel.
Kings guard:  Foreign bastard.
The Kings guard draws his sword. Before he can strike, Syrio hits him with his wooden stick. Knocking him out.
Syrio Forel:  And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Meryn Trant:  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
Syrio Forel:  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Syrio Forel fights three Kings guards at once, eventually knocking them all out.
Meryn Trant:  Bloody oafs.
Syrio Forel:  Be gone now, Arya.
Arya Stark:  Come with me. Run.
Syrio Forel:  The first sword of Braavos does not run.
Meryn Trant strikes Syrio, a short duel takes place. Eventually Meryn Trant cuts Syrio Forel's wooden sword into pieces.
Syrio Forel:  What do we say to the God of death?
Arya Stark:  Not today.
Syrio Forel:  Go.

Arya Stark runs off and hears a bunch of screams from down the hallway. She looks concerned.
Arya Stark:  Not today. Not today.

Back on the other side of the Red Keep, Sansa runs on, but is stopped by a familiar face.

Sansa Stark:  Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father. I'll...I'll tell the Queen.
Sandor Clegane:  Who do you think sent me?

Back to Arya, we see that she has arrived at the slaughtered stewards. She sees her belongings lying on the ground.

Arya Stark:  Needle.
A stable boy appears.
Stable Boy:  There she is.
Arya Stark:  What do you want?
Stable Boy:  I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
Arya Stark:  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
Stable Boy:  She'll reward me, the Queen!
Arya Stark:  Stay away!
Accidentally, she turns around sliding Needle through the stable boys belly. Her first kill is a fact.
Shook as she is, she runs off.
At the Kings Landing catacombs, Varys goes out to see Ned Stark.
Varys:  You've seen better days, my lord.
Eddard Stark:  Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
Varys:  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
Eddard Stark:  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
Varys:  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.
Eddard Stark:  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
Varys:  When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord.
Eddard Stark:  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
Varys:  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.
Eddard Stark:  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?
Varys:  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
Eddard Stark:  Robb? He's just a boy.
Varys:  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
Eddard Stark:  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
Varys:  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
Eddard Stark:  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
Varys:  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
Eddard Stark:  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
Varys:  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?

Theon shoots a raven coming from The Twins. Robb picks it up and reads the message.

Robb Stark:  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
Theon Greyjoy:  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
Catelyn Stark:  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
Robb Stark:  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
Greatjon Umber:  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
Robb Stark:  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
Theon Greyjoy:  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
Greatjon Umber:  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
Catelyn Stark:  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
Robb Stark:  Have my horse saddled and ready.
Greatjon Umber:  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
Theon Greyjoy:  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
Robb Stark:  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
Catelyn Stark:  l agree. l'll go.
Everyone:  You can't!
Catelyn Stark:  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
Greatjon Umber:  Unless there was a profit in it.

Catelyn finds herself inside the Twins, which the Freys gathered to watch her audience with Lord Walder.

Walder Frey:  What do you want?
Catelyn Stark:  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
Walder Frey:  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?
Stevron Frey:  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is 
Walder Frey:  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?
Ryger Rivers:  Father, please 
Walder Frey:  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.
(gestures to Catelyn) All right, you come forward.
(kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
Catelyn Stark:  ls there somewhere we can talk?
Walder Frey:  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
(taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too.
(To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure she will give you many sons.
Walder Frey:  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
Catelyn Stark:  He is quite ill, my lord.
Walder Frey:  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
Catelyn Stark:  My lord, l 
Walder Frey:  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure there were reasons 
Walder Frey:  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
Catelyn Stark:  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
Walder Frey:  Why should l let him?
Catelyn Stark:  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
Walder Frey:  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
Catelyn Stark:  You swore an oath to my father.
Walder Frey:  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
Catelyn Stark:  Why don't you?
Walder Frey:  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?

--------------------------------

At Castle Black, Jon Snow and Commander Mormont are having a chat.

Voices outside:  And engage!
Jeor Mormont:  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
Jon Snow:  Soon, he says.
Jeor Mormont:  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.
Jon Snow:  This is Valyrian steel.
Jeor Mormont:  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
Jon Snow:  My lord, you honor me, but l can't 
Jeor Mormont:  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?
Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
Jeor Mormont:  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.
Jon Snow:  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
Jeor Mormont:  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist  l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.

Jon Snow leaves the room and emerges outside, heading towards the mess hall.
Unidentified Nights Watchers:  Well done. Well done.
Nights Watcher #1:  You earned that, Snow.
Nights Watcher #2:  Well done.

Jon arrives at the mess hall. The other men gather around him to see his new sword, but Sam remains seated at a distance, looking distraught.

Pyp:  Go on, let's have a look.
Jon Snow:  At what?
Grenn:  The sword! Show us the sword.
All:  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
Pyp:  Let's have a look.
Grenn:  Piss off.
Pyp:  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!
Grenn:  Look at its eyes.
While the others are playing with the sword, Jon gets seated beside Sam.
Jon Snow:  What is it?
Samwell Tarly:  l - l can't.
Jon Snow:  You can't what?
Samwell Tarly:  l'm really not supposed to say.
Jon Snow:  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that
Samwell Tarly:  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
Jon Snow:  What? What about him?
Samwell Tarly:  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.
Jon Snow:  l should be there. l should be with him.

--------------------------
Back at the Crossing, Catelyn returns from her conversation with Walder Frey at the Twins, and finds Robb and the others having a meeting in his tent.

Greatjon Umber:  lf we do that, they'll never get back across.
Robb Stark:  Well? What did he say?
Catelyn Stark:  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.
Robb Stark:  Huh.
Catelyn Stark:  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
Robb Stark:  What does he want in return?
Catelyn Stark:  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
Robb Stark:   Fine, fine. And?
Catelyn Stark:  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
Robb Stark:  She won't be happy about that. And?
Catelyn Stark:  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
Robb Stark:  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
Catelyn Stark:  l did.
Robb Stark:  And?
Catelyn Stark:  One was  Do you consent?
Robb Stark:  Can l refuse?
Catelyn Stark:  Not if you want to cross.
Robb Stark:  Then l consent.
Robb leaves the meeting right away. Theon laughs while Catelyn watches.
We cut to a shot of Robbs men on the other side of the river, having already crossed the Green Fork of the Trident and heading south.

--------------
Back at Castle Black. Jon goes to see Maester Aemon, finding him cutting meat to serve to the ravens.
Jon Snow:  Sam said you wanted to see me?
Maester Aemon:  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
Jon Snow:  No.
Maester Aemon:  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
Jon Snow:  He would do whatever was right, no matter what.
Maester Aemon:  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
Jon Snow:  Sam told you.
Maester Aemon:  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.
Jon Snow:  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
Maester Aemon:  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.
Jon Snow:  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
Maester Aemon:  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.
Jon Snow:  Who are you?
Maester Aemon:  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.
Jon Snow:  You're Aemon Targaryen.
Maester Aemon:  l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.


------------------------------
Across the Narrow Sea, the Dothraki are on the move. Drogo leads them, but seems to have fainted. Daenerys rides right behind him.

Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) My lord My sun and stars Drogo.
Drogo falls off his horse.
Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) My horse
Cohollo:  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood
Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!

---------------------
At the Lannister camp, Tywin is presiding over lunch/war meeting. Tyrion gets there while everyones already seated and eating.
Kevan Lannister:  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
Tywin Lannister:  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
Tyrion Lannister:  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
Tywin Lannister:  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
Kevan Lannister:  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.
Tyrion Lannister:  Shagga likes axes.
Tywin Lannister:  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
Tyrion Lannister:  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
Kevan Lannister:  They do seem rather ferocious.
Tyrion Lannister:  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
Tywin Lannister:  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
Tyrion Lannister:  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
Tywin Lannister:  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.

Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman (a prostitute) waiting there too.
Tyrion Lannister:  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
Bronn:  l took her.
Tyrion Lannister:  Took her? From whom?
Bronn:  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
Tyrion Lannister:  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
Bronn:  He said something.
Tyrion Lannister:  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
Bronn:  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.
Bronn leaves. Tyrion addresses the prostitute.
Tyrion Lannister:  Who are you?
Prostitute:  Who would you like me to be?
Tyrion Lannister:  What did your mother call you?
Prostitute:  Shae. What did your mother call you?
Tyrion Lannister:  My mother died giving birth to me.
Shae:  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
Tyrion Lannister:  What sort of accent is that?
Shae:  Foreign.
Tyrion Lannister:  For-
Shae:  What do you want from me?
Tyrion Lannister:  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.
Shae:  And what do l get?
Tyrion Lannister:  One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.
Shae:  Who told you this? Women you paid?
Tyrion Lannister:  And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
Shae gets undressed and kisses Tyrion.
Shae:  Let's start with your last night in this world.

------------------------------

Back across the Narrow Sea. Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki (no subtitles provided) inside a tent, Daenerys by his side.

Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
Jorah removes an herbal treatment from Drogos wound, revealing it has become infected.
Jorah Mormont:  He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
Jorah Mormont:  Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
Jorah Mormont:  He's already gone, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.
Jorah Mormont:  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
Mirri Maz Duur enters the tent, and bows to Daenerys. Qotho comes to check on Drogo too, with a few other bloodriders at the entrance.
Mirri Maz Duur:  The wound has festered.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
Qotho and the other Dothraki leave.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.
Jorah Mormont:  l think you're right.
Jorah leaves the tent.
Mirri Maz Duur:  You've saved me once more.
Daenerys Targaryen:  And now you must save him.
Mirri Maz Duur:  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some  some magic.
Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Do it. Save him.
Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a price.
Daenerys Targaryen:   You'll have gold, whatever you want.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
Daenerys Targaryen:  My death?
Mirri Maz Duur:  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
Daenerys signals to Irri, who leaves to find the horse. We cut to the horse being taken by a rope into to the tent.
Rakharo:  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
Daenerys Targaryen:   Kill her and you kill your khal.
Rakharo:  This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
Mirri Maz Duur starts an incantation
Mirri Maz Duur:  Go. Now.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Take her and leave. Take her!
Mirri Maz Duur:  You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
Daenerys caresses Drogos forehand as she moves to leave.
Daenerys Targaryen:  No one will enter.
Mirri Maz Duur slits the horses throat. Blood spills all over Drogos chest and Daenerys face.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Bring him back to me.
Daenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her.
What have you done?
Daenerys Targaryen:  l have to save him.
We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This must not be.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) This must be.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Witch.
Rakharo:  (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.
Rakharo tries to talk to Qotho, but gets sucker punched in the face.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) No, you can't.
Qotho unsheaths his dagger and moves past Daenerys, pushing her towards the ground. Daenerys hits the ground with her belly.
Irri:  Khaleesi!
Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) No further, horselord.
Daenerys starts moaning in pain, while we hear Mirri Maz Duurs incantations in the background. Qotho turns around and lunges towards Jorah. The two fight, but Jorah gains the upper hand and kills him with a sword blow to the face.
Jorah Mormont:  Are you hurt?
Daenerys Targaryen: The baby 
Jorah Mormont:  Hmm?
Daenerys Targaryen:  is coming.
Jorah Mormont:  Fetch the midwives.
Rakharo:  They will not come. They say she is cursed.
Jorah Mormont:  They'll come or l'll have their heads.
Rakharo:  The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
Jorah moves inside the tent with Daenerys in his arms, as screams and incantations from the inside start getting louder and louder in tone.

-----------------------
At the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn and Shae are drinking together inside Tyrions tent at night, before the battle.

Shae:  Are you in agony, my lion?
Tyrion Lannister:  No.
Shae:  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
Tyrion Lannister:  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
Shae:  Just used to it.
Bronn:   Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  Let's play a new game.
Bronn:  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
Tyrion Lannister:  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Bronn:  Not if you win.
Tyrion Lannister:  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.
Shae:  What are you good at?
Tyrion Lannister:  l happen to be a great judge of character.
Bronn:  This sounds like a boring game.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.
Shae:  l don't want to play this game.
Tyrion Lannister:  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
Bronn drinks.
Bronn:  But my mother hit harder.
Tyrion Lannister:  You killed your first man before you were 12.
Bronn:  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.
Tyrion Lannister:  You've been north of the Wall.
Shae:  What brought you up there?
Bronn:  Work.
Tyrion Lannister:  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
Shae:  l don't want to play.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion drinks.
Tyrion Lannister:  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  And we've established the rules about lying?
Shae:  Drink!
Tyrion drinks.
Tyrion Lannister:  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
Bronn:  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
Tyrion Lannister:  So, specifics You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  Are you sure 
Shae:  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.
Tyrion Lannister:  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.
Shae:  My turn.
Tyrion Lannister:  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
Shae:  Who were you in love with?
Tyrion Lannister:  That's not how the game works.
Shae:  l don't care the way the game works.
Bronn:  Our lord here used to be married.
Shae:  Married?
Tyrion Lannister:  How did you hear that?
Bronn:  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
Tyrion Lannister:  Another night, perhaps.
Shae:  Not another night. This night.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not a pleasant story.
Shae:  Oh, maybe l will cry.
Bronn:  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
Tyrion Lannister:  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.
Bronn:  For three chickens, l should hope so.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.
Bronn:  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.
Tyrion Lannister:  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
Bronn:  l would have killed the man who did that to me.
Shae:  You should have known she was a whore.
Tyrion Lannister:  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.
Shae:  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
Tyrion Lannister:  As l said, l was young and stupid.
Shae:  You are still young and stupid.
Shae starts kissing Tyrion, causing Bronn to leave the tent. The next day, the Lannisters ride to battle; Bronn returns to Tyrions tent to wake him and Shae up.
Tyrion Lannister:  What is it? What do you want?
Bronn:  You're sleeping through the war.
Tyrion Lannister:  What?
Bronn:  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
Tyrion Lannister:  Get my squire!
Bronn:  You don't have a squire.
Tyrion Lannister:  lf l die, weep for me.
Shae:  You'll be dead. How will you know?
Tyrion Lannister:  l'll know.
Tyrion leaves the tent, fully armoured.
Lannister soldier : Watch out! Move!
Lannister soldier : Out of the way! Move aside!
Bronn:  Stay low.
Tyrion Lannister:  Stay low?
Bronn:  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.
Tyrion Lannister:  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!
Tribesmen of the Vale (chanting): Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
Tyrion Lannister:  To battle!
Tyrion rides to battle with the rest, but turns around quickly after and is hit with a mace from one of the Tribesmen. He passes out. Later, we cut to the end of the battle  dead bodies and swords piling on the ground. Tyrion wakes up to find Bronn talking to him as hes carried on a wheelbarrow.
Bronn:  You're a shit warrior.
Tyrion Lannister:  l'm alive?
Bronn:  You're alive.
Tyrion Lannister:  Did we win?
Bronn:  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
Tyrion Lannister:  How did our tribesmen do?
Bronn:  Yeah, good.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's nice to see them getting along.
Tywin shows up next to them, fully armoured and on horseback.
Tywin Lannister:  You're wounded.
Tyrion Lannister:  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
Tywin Lannister:  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].
Tyrion Lannister:  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
Tywin Lannister:  He wasn't here.
Tyrion Lannister:  Where was he?
Tywin Lannister:  With his other 18,000 men.
Tyrion Lannister:  And where are they?

--------------
We cut to Catelyn and Rodrik Cassel overlooking the Trident from a safe distance at higher ground.
Rodrik Cassel:  We should go, my lady.
Catelyn Stark:  No!
Rodrik Cassel:  My lady!
Stark bannermen:  Hyah! Hyah!
The Stark host arrives at the clearing. Robb is amongst them, and he comes carrying a tied and bound Jaime Lannister.
Robb Stark:  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
Jaime Lannister:  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.
Catelyn Stark:  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
Jaime Lannister:  l've lost them too, l'm afraid.
Theon Greyjoy:  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
Robb Stark:  He's more use to us alive than dead.
Catelyn Stark:  Take him away and put him in irons.
Jaime Lannister:  We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
Robb Stark:  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
Greatjon Umber:  Come on, pretty man.
Robb Stark:  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
Theon Greyjoy:  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
Robb Stark:  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.

-----------------------
At Kings Landing, Arya is chasing down pigeons on the street while staying hidden from the Kingsguard. She catches one and snaps its neck. Soon afterwards, she sees a bakers stall with pastries on display.

Arya Stark:  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
Kings Landing Baker:  Three coppers.
Arya Stark:  How about a nice fat pigeon?
Kings Landing Baker:  Oh, piss off now. Go on.
Arya Stark:  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
Kings Landing Baker:  Piss off!
Everyone starts walking up the street, leaving Arya confused. Two street urchins run past her up the stairs.
Arya Stark:  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
Street Urchin:  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
Arya Stark:  Who?
Street Urchin:  The Hand of the King.
Arya follows the crowd to the Sept of Baelor. She climbs up the pedestal of Baelors statue to get a better view of her surroundings. We cut to Ned Stark being taken from the sept and into the courtyard, in full view of the gathered populace; Baelors statue is seen on the background to his left. Ned catches Aryas eye at the foot of the statue.
Populace:  Traitor! Coward!
Ned is taken across the populace and runs into Yoren of the Nights Watch.
Eddark Stark:  Baelor!
Yoren looks towards the statue knowingly.
Populace:  Traitor! Traitor!
Ned is taken to a raised platform where Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger are standing. Sansa smiles warmly at her father as he addresses the crowd.
Eddark Stark:  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
The townsfolk roar with approval; Arya leaves the pedestal and runs towards the commotion. Sansa gets visibly distraught and starts yelling as a member of the Kingsguard holds her back.

Sansa Stark:  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!
Cersei Baratheon: My son, this is madness.
Populace: Put him down!
Varys runs to the platform to talk to Cersei and Joffrey, Ilyn Payne puts on his executioners mask. Arya marches towards the courtyard but is grabbed by the arm by Yoren.
Yoren: Don't look!
Arya Stark:  Let me go.
Yoren:  Shut your mouth. Look at me.
Sansa Stark:  Stop him, stop!

From Neds perspective, the roars of the crowd become almost silent; he looks towards Baelors statue but finds no one there. He lowers his head in recognition of his fate as the sound of Paynes longsword cuts through the hushed silence. We see the sword swing until it reaches his head, with a direct cut to Arya as Yoren prevents her from seeing the actual execution. Arya looks at the sky; a flock of pigeons flies away from the courtyard as she holds her head against Yorens chest; she sighs heavily, and the screen cuts to black.
We begin where Baelor left off; after the execution of Ned Stark, we see Ilyn Paynes bloodied sword and the Hound picking up Neds head to show it to the rapturous townsfolk. We then pan to Arya, her eyes closed and her face pressed against Yorens chest.

Yoren:  Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

Yoren takes Arya with him away from the mob and into a flight of stairs; on the courtyard, Sansa faints.

Yoren:  Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)
Arya Stark:  l'm not a boy!
Yoren:  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Aryas hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north.

------------------------------------------
At Winterfell, Bran has a dream in which he can walk and sees a three-eyed raven. He then talks about this dream with Osha.

Bran Stark:  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
Osha:  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
Bran Stark:  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
Osha:  l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
Bran Stark:  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.

Osha takes Bran to the crypts. She carries him with her arms while he lights the way with a torch.
Bran Stark:  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.
Osha:  You see? He's not here.

A loud roar is heard and a shadow moves in front of them. A direwolf runs towards them; Osha falls to the ground with him. We see Shaggydog barking at them viciously.
Rickon Stark:  Here, Shaggydog.
Bran Stark:  Rickon!
Osha:  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
Rickon Stark:  He doesn't like chains.
Bran Stark:  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
Rickon Stark:  No, l came to see Father.
Bran Stark:  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
Rickon Stark:  He was down here. l saw him.
Bran Stark:  Saw him when?
Rickon Stark:  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.

Rickon leaves with Shaggydog, while Osha looks puzzled at Bran. We cut to a shot of her carrying him outside.

Osha:  You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that 
Maester Luwin:  Bran

--------------------------------------
Catelyn Stark walks alone through the Stark camp. Several bannermen bow to her respectfully as she passes.

Several Stark Bannermen:  My lady. My lady. My lady.

She reaches a small forest outside camp and collapses in grief by one of the trees, crying and sobbing. She hears some screams and the sound of a sword slashing wood nearby. As she gets closer, she realizes its Robb, fully armoured, slashing his sword against a tree while crying.

Catelyn Stark:  Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
Robb drops his sword to the ground and goes to Catelyn. She hugs him and caresses his neck, trying to console him.
Catelyn Stark:  Shh! Shh! Shh!
Robb Stark:  l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
Catelyn Stark:  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.

-------------------------------------
At the Throne Room on the Red Keep, Marillion the bard is singing a song for Joffrey and his retinue. Cercei stands by his side, while Sansa overlooks the scene from one of the colonnades.

Marillion:  (singing)
The boar's great tusks, they boded ill
For good King Robert's health
And the beast was every bit as fat
As Robert was himself
But our brave king cried,
"Do your worst!
l'll have your ugly head!
You're nowhere near as murd'rous as
the lion in my bed"
King Robert lost his battle and
He failed his final test,
The lion ripped his balls off,
And the boar did all the rest.

Joffrey Baratheon:  Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
Marillion:  l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?
Marillion:  Your Grace?
Sansa looks at Joffrey, despondent.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
Marillion:  Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Good. Tongue it is.
Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
Marillion:  l beg you! Please, no. No!
Ilyn Payne marches towards the fire to heat up his dagger.
Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! (screaming) No!
Joffrey Baratheon:  l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
Marillion:  (screaming) Your Grace, please!

As Joffrey leaves with Meryn Trant and the Hound, he passes by Sansa. Marillion is still screaming and begging in the background.
Joffrey Baratheon:  You look quite nice.
Sansa Stark:  Thank you, my lord.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Your Grace. l'm King now.
Marillion:  (screaming) Stop! No!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Walk with me. l want to show you something.
Sandor Clegane:  Do as you're bid, child.

Joffrey and Sansa are outside, walking past across a row of spears in the Red Keep. Trant and Clegane follow behind them.
Joffrey Baratheon:  And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.
The pikes have impaled heads on them. Sansa looks away.
Sansa Stark:  No! Please, no!
Joffrey Baratheon:  (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
Sansa Stark:  You promised to be merciful.
Joffrey Baratheon:  l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
Sansa Stark:  Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear 
Joffrey Baratheon:  Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!
Sansa looks up at the head of her father.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Well?
Sansa Stark:  How long do l have to look?
Joffrey Baratheon:  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
Sansa Stark:  lf it please Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
Sansa Stark:  Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)
Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but shes stopped by the Hound.
Sandor Clegane:  Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)
Joffrey Baratheon:  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
Sandor Clegane:  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.
Sansa tries to give him is handkerchief back.
Sandor Clegane:  You'll be needing that again.
Sandor leaves, leaving Sansa alone at the bridge. She looks at the heads atop the pikes and cries.

--------------------------------------------------------
War meeting at the Stark camp. They sit at the table at night by torchlight.

Jonos Bracken:  The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
Robb Stark:  Renly is not the king.
Jonos Bracken:  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.
Robb Stark:  That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
Jonos Bracken:  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
Galbart Glover:  Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis
Greatjon Umber:  My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! (The Greatjon bows to Robb with his sword unsheathed; Robb rises)
Rickard Karstark:  l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. (bows to Robb and extends him his sword) The King in the North!
Theon Greyjoy:  Am l your brother, now and always?
Robb Stark:  Now and always.
Theon Greyjoy:  (takes out his sword, bows to Robb) My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
Greatjon Umber:  The King in the North!
All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
They all take out their swords and swear fealty to Robb as Catelyn looks wearily at the whole scene.
All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!

Catelyn goes to the outskirts of their camp, to the dungeons where prisoners are being kept.
Stark Guard:  Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark:  l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
They walk for a while until they reach a single prisoner (Jaime), kept away far from the rest.
Catelyn Stark:  Leave us. (the guards leave)
Jaime Lannister:  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman.
Catelyn Stark:  l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
Jaime Lannister:  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.
Catelyn Stark:  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
Jaime Lannister:  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
Catelyn Stark:  Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
Jaime Lannister:  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
Catelyn Stark:  Because of men like you.
Jaime Lannister:  There are no men like me. Only me.
Catelyn Stark:  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
Jaime Lannister:  l pushed him out the window.
Catelyn Stark:  Why?
Jaime Lannister:  I hoped the fall would kill him.
Catelyn Stark:  Why?
Jaime Lannister:  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away)

-----------------------------------------
Cersei and Lancel are having one of their rendezvous on her bedchamber. Cersei is reading a message while Lancel speaks, naked.

Lancel Lannister:  l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
Cersei Lannister:  Stop talking. Get back into bed.

-----------------------------------------
Back in the Riverlands, we sit with the Lannister war meeting. Tywin, Tyrion and Kevan are in assistance.

Tywin Lannister:  They have my son.
Tyrion Lannister:  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
Leo Lefford:  l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
Addam Marbrand:  ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
Kevan Lannister:  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
Tyrion Lannister:  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning  in case you hadn't noticed.
Kevan Lannister:  l'm told we still have his sisters.
Leo Lefford:  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
Addam Marbrand: Kevan Lannister:  First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise 
Tywin Lannister:  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now  madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. 
Tyrion Lannister:  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
Tywin Lannister:  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
Tyrion Lannister:  And do what?
Tywin Lannister:  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest  Baelish, Varys, Pycelle
Tyrion Lannister:  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
Tywin Lannister:  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?

-------------------------------------------
Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is sleeping inside a yurt. Jorah is sitting beside her when she wakes up.

Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah?
Jorah Mormont:  Gently, gently.
Daenerys Targaryen:  My son  where is he? l want him. Where is he?
Jorah Mormont:  The boy did not live.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Tell me.
Jorah Mormont:  What is there to tell?
Daenerys Targaryen:  How did my son die?
Jorah Mormont:  He never lived, my princess. The women say 
Daenerys Targaryen:  What do the women say?
Jorah Mormont:  They say the child was 
Mirri Maz Duur:  (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
Mirri Maz Duur:  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.
Jorah Mormont:  Time enough for that later 
Daenerys Targaryen:  l want to see him now.

They leave the tent/yurt, following Mirri Maz Duur to the place where Drogo is lying.
Daenerys Targaryen:  The khalasar is gone.
Jorah Mormont:  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?
Jorah Mormont:  He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
Mirri Maz Duur:  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (looking at Drogos catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
Mirri Maz Duur:  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Leave us.
Jorah Mormont:  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
Daenerys and Mirri Maz Duur have a conversation alone.
Daenerys Targaryen:  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
Daenerys Targaryen:  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l spoke for you. l saved you.
Mirri Maz Duur:  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
Daenerys Targaryen:  Your life.
Mirri Maz Duur:  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

At Castle Black, Jon is preparing to leave in the night and desert the Nights Watch; Sam is there to try to talk him out of it.

Samwell Tarly:  You can't!
Jon Snow:  Get out of my way, Sam.
Samwell Tarly:  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
Jon Snow:  Better than you do.
Samwell Tarly:  What are you going to do?
Jon Snow:  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback)
Samwell Tarly:  You can't leave us now. We need you here.
Jon Snow:  Move.
Samwell Tarly:  l won't let you go.
Jon Snow:  Move.
Samwell Tarly:  No.
Jon Snow:  Hyah!
Jon rides his horse away from Castle Black, his horse kicking Sam to the ground as he was standing in the way. Ghost follows him out.

In the Lannister camp in the Riverlands, Tyrion and Shae are talking inside his tent about his recent appointment.
Shae:  Hand of the King?
Tyrion Lannister:  So it would seem.
Shae:  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
Tyrion Lannister:  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
Shae:  He knew my name?
Tyrion Lannister:  What?
Shae:  He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
Tyrion Lannister:  l believe he used the word "whore".
Shae:  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
Tyrion laughs.
Shae:  Im funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
Tyrion Lannister:  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand  (Shae kisses Tyrion)
Shae:  l know what a Hand needs.

------------------------------------
Jon and Ghost are being chased by his fellow Nights Watch brothers through a forest not long after he left.
Jon Snow:  Ghost?
Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
During the chase, Sam hits his head on a tree branch and falls off his horse. The others and later Jon stop to assist him.
Grenn:  Samwell!
Pyp:  ls he dead?
Grenn:  No, he's not dead.
Samwell Tarly:  Did we get him?
Grenn:  Come on, help me get him up.
Pyp:  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon)  We're taking you back to where you belong.
Jon Snow:  l belong with my brother.
Samwell Tarly:   But we're your brothers now.
Grenn:  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
Jon Snow:  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
Pyp:  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
Grenn:  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
Jon Snow:  l have to.
Grenn:  You can't. You said the words.
Jon Snow:  I don't care about 
Samwell Tarly:  "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow"
Jon Snow:  To hell with all of you.
Pyp:  "Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
Grenn:  "l am the sword in the darkness  "
Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  (in unison, reciting the vow) "l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.
Sam brings Longclaw to Jon, who accepts it.

Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is tending to Drogo and his wounds inside a yurt.

Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
We cut to Daenerys standing with her head pressing against Drogos chest, now visibly more distressed.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (crying)  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
Daenerys kisses Drogo, then uses a pillow to smother him.

------------------------------------------
In Kings Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone (unseen at first) in his bedchambers.

Grand Maester Pycelle:  Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is  For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal  powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.

Ros gets dressed while Pycelle keeps talking.
Grand Maester Pycelle:   He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.
Ros is listening, but seems really bored by the whole thing.
Ros:  So what's the thing?
Grand Maester Pycelle:  What thing?
Ros:  About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".
Grand Maester Pycelle:  What? Things? What?
Ros:  When you started, you Never mind.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Let me see you out, my dear.
Ros:  lt's all right. No need.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right.
He gets dressed in his robes and looks at himself in the mirror with pride. Before he leaves his chambers, he moves from an upright position to the hunchback hes always seen with in public. Hes faking it.

In the Throne Room, Littlefinger and Varys have a chat overlooking the Iron Throne.
Varys:  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
Petyr Baelish:  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
Varys:  A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldn't bet against you.
Petyr Baelish:  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
Varys:  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
Petyr Baelish:  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
Varys:  Oh, you can do better than that.
Petyr Baelish:  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.
Varys:  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
Petyr Baelish:  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
Varys:  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
Petyr Baelish:  Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.
Varys:  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
Petyr Baelish:  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
Varys:  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men  and women.
Petyr Baelish:  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
Varys:  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
Petyr Baelish:  Playing our roles.
Varys:  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King.
Petyr Baelish:  Long may he reign. My king. (bows)
Varys:  My king.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My lords. Shall we begin?

Elsewhere in Kings Landing, Yoren is taking Arya to safety, away from the city.
Yoren:  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
Arya Stark:  Arry.
Yoren:  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time   men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot  half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself  and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
Arya bumps into a fat recruit, Hot Pie.
Hot Pie:  Watch yourself, midget.
Lommy Greenhands:  He's got a sword, this one.
Hot Pie:  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
Lommy Greenhands:  Maybe he's a little squire.
Hot Pie:  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
Lommy Greenhands:  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)
Hot Pie:  l could use me a sword like that.
Lommy Greenhands:  Take it off him.
Hot Pie:  Give it here, midget.
Lommy Greenhands:  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
Hot Pie:  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
Arya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
Hot Pie bumps into Gendry, Roberts bastard.
Gendry:  Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
Arya Stark:  lt was a gift.
Gendry:  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.
Arya Stark:  Which are you?
Gendry:  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
Yoren:  (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!

The caravan of the Nights Watch leaves the walls of Kings Landing.

-------------------------------------

Back at Castle Black, Jon is serving Commander Mormont his breakfast.
Jeor Mormont:  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
(Jon looks at the Lord Commander with surprise) Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.
Jon Snow:  My friends brought me back.
Jeor Mormont:  l didn't say it was your honor.
Jon Snow:  They killed my father.
Jeor Mormont:  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
Jon Snow:  No.
Jeor Mormont:  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?
Jon Snow:  No.
Jeor Mormont:  Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
Jon Snow:  Beyond the Wall?
Jeor Mormont:  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

The Men of the Nights Watch gather their forces at leave to range Beyond the Wall. Lord Commander Mormont leads them, with Jon amongst his brothers.

-------------------------------------------------

Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is leading a ceremony for Drogo after his death.

Rakharo:  (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogos funeral pyre)
Jorah Mormont:  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
Daenerys Targaryen:  They were not given to me to sell.
Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l must. You don't understand.
Jorah Mormont:  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
Daenerys Targaryen:  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
Mirri Maz Duur is shown tied and bound by rope.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.
(to the crowd)  l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria. I am the Dragons daughter. And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.
Mirri Maz Duur:  You will not hear me scream.
Daenerys Targaryen:  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.

Daenerys walks towards the pyre and lights it on fire with a torch. Mirri Maz Duur starts uttering some incantations which quickly turn into screaming. Daenerys walks into the burning pyre as her dress catches fire. The flames engulf everything, and the screen fades to black.
We then cut to the next day in the morning. Jorah goes to the pyre to see if theres anything left of it. Amidst the smoke, a naked Daenerys appears, covered in soot and carrying three baby dragons in her arms and back.
Jorah Mormont:  (bowing)  Blood of my blood.

Everyone else bows to her as her dragons start screeching. We cut to black over a final screech from one her dragons.
TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT. KINGS LANDING

The Hound and another man grunt as they duel. Men and women look on from nearby. The Hound knocks the other mans shield away, and knocks the man off of a wall. The camera pans up from the man to where Joffrey stands in a tent, watching.

JOFFREY: (Quietly) Well struck (Louder) Well struck, Dog.

The Hound removes his helmet. Joffrey turns to Sansa.

JOFFREY: Did you like that?

SANSA: It was well struck, Your Grace.

JOFFREY: I already said it was well struck.

SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.

Two men drag the man away, leaving behind a trail of blood. A boy walks over to clean up the blood.

JOFFREY: Who's next?

ANNOUNCER: Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

The announcer gestures to a man, who then walks over.

ANNOUNCER: Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

The announcer gestures in the opposite direction, but no one comes forward.

ANNOUNCER: (Yells) Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

SER DONTOS: Here I am. (Walking down some stairs, awkwardly clutching his helmet and weapon).  Here I am. (Drops his helmet). Sorry, Your Grace. (Puts his helmet on backwards). My deepest apologies. (Puts his helmet on correctly).

JOFFREY: Are you drunk?

Ser Dontos takes off his helmet.

SER DONTOS: No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.

JOFFREY: Two cups? (Dontos nods). That's not much at all. (Joffrey gestures to some wine). Please, have another cup.

SER DONTOS: Are you sure, Your Grace?

JOFFREY: Yes, to celebrate my name day. (Smiles) Have two, have as much as you like.

SER DONTOS: I would be honored, Your Grace.

Ser Dontos bows to Joffrey. Joffrey looks over to Ser Meryn.

JOFFREY: Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.

Ser Meryn and two other kingsguard grab Ser Dontos. They bring him into a more open area nearby. Ser Dontos is forced on his knees. One kingsguard keeps Ser Dontos down. Ser Meryn and the other kingsguard get a funnel and a barrel of wine. Ser Meryn forces the funnel into Ser Dontoss mouth. The kingsguard with the barrel begins pouring the wine down the funnel. Ser Dontos begins gurgling and struggles a little bit.

SANSA: You can't!

JOFFREY: What did you say? Did you say I can't?

SANSA: I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.

JOFFREY: What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

THE HOUND: The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.

JOFFREY: (Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

The barrel and funnel are removed, and Ser Dontos is released. He pukes out a mixture of blood and wine onto the ground.

SANSA: He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

JOFFREY: Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool.

SER DONTOS: Thank you, Your Grace. (Bows). And you, My Lady, thank you.

Ser Dontos is taken away by kingsguard.

TYRION: Beloved nephew.

Tyrion, Bronn, and a number of hill tribesman appear from the right. People murmur and look their way.

TYRION: We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.

Tyrion begins to pour himself a glass of wine.

JOFFREY: I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

TYRION: What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me.

Tyrion gestures towards the Hound. Bronn looks over at the Hound and smiles wryly.

BRONN: Can't imagine why.

JOFFREY: We heard you were dead.

MYRCELLA: I'm glad you're not dead.

Tyrion takes a sip of his wine.

TYRION: Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

Tyrion bows to Sansa. Joffrey looks over at her, and back to Tyrion.

JOFFREY: Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!

TYRION: But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.

SANSA: My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

TYRION: Of course you are.

Tyrion smirks sympathetically. Sansa looks away.

TYRION: Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.

Tyrion begins walking away from the tent.

JOFFREY: What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?

INT. SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER

The council members sit at a table. A man walks to the table with a covered bird cage.

PYCELLE: The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.

VARYS: The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.

PYCELLE: A common superstition.

BAELISH: We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants.

JANOS: The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

Cersei gestures to a servant. The servant comes to take the raven off of the table.

CERSEI: You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?

JANOS: I do, Your Grace.

CERSEI: And are you not a Lord at my command?

JANOS: I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.

JANOS: Yes, Your Grace.

Tyrion begins whistling from a distance. Everyone at the table turns to watch him approach.

TYRION: Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.

CERSEI: What are you doing here?

TYRION: (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.

Tyrion begins drinking his wine.

CERSEI: What are you doing here? This is the small council.

TYRION: Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.

CERSEI: Our father is Hand of the King.

TYRION: Yes, but in his absence

Tyrion pulls out a letter. He hands it to Varys, who opens it, and begins reading it.

VARYS: Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -

CERSEI: Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.

TYRION: If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down).

CERSEI: I've done nothing.

TYRION: Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.

CERSEI: I tried to stop it.

TYRION: Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

CERSEI: Robb Stark is a child.

TYRION: Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?

CERSEI: What do you know about warfare?

TYRION: Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

There is a long pause. Cersei looks over at Tyrion.

CERSEI: Joffrey is King.

TYRION: Joffrey is King.

CERSEI: You are here to advise him.

TYRION: I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

CERSEI: How?

TYRION: You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.

CERSEI: One.

TYRION: One?

CERSEI: Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

TYRION: Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.

Tyrion smirks, and takes a sip of his wine. Cersei looks away.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

EXT. OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

A knight sits on a horse alone, holding a banner. Winterfell is seen in the background.

LORD: My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

INT. INSIDE WINTERFELLS KEEP

A long queue of people are waiting to speak with Bran. The man speaking is addressing Bran and Maester Luwin, who are both sitting at a large table.

LORD: The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

LUWIN: Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

LORD: Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.

BRAN: King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.

LORD: Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.

BRAN: Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?

LORD: Of course I remember!

LUWIN: We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

LORD: I - I believe it will.

The man walks away. After a moment, Luwin turns to Bran.

LUWIN: We didn't want him here all day, did we?

BRAN: I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

LUWIN: Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.

PORTAN: (Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

EXT. WOODS

The camera changes to first-person. A character is running through the woods, panting.  The character looks up to the red comet above the trees, and then back down to the pool in the godswood. The character approaches the pool and looks down at their reflection, revealing themselves to be Summer, Brans direwolf.

INT. BRANS BEDROOM

Bran lays in his bed, asleep. His eyes suddenly open.

EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT DAY

Hodor walks with Bran on his back, closely following Osha. Osha squats next to some plants. Hodor continues walking.

OSHA: Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.

Osha pockets some of the plant.

BRAN: Don't have any pain.

OSHA: Lucky for you.

BRAN: That way.

Bran points, and Hodor changes direction, heading for the godswood. Osha turns and begins following them.

OSHA: You've been having those dreams again.

BRAN: I don't dream.

OSHA: Everyone dreams.

BRAN: I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.

OSHA: Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodors back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.

Osha places Bran on the ground. He begins crawling towards the edge of the pool.

OSHA: The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.

Bran looks at his reflection in the pool.

BRAN: The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.

CUT TO: ESSOS

EXT. DESERT

Some people walk through the desert. The camera pans up to reveal Daenerys, with Drogon on her shoulder, and her Khalasar. Daenerys attempts to feed Drogon some meat, but he refuses.

DOREAH: What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

DAENERYS: He said they ate meat.

DOREAH: He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

DAENERYS: My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.

Doreah looks down dejectedly. Daenerys gets Drogon off of her shoulder and into his cage. At the front of the group, a horse suddenly collapses. Jorah jogs forward to investigate. Daenerys follows after him. Daenerys kneels down to look at the horse. She looks up at Jorah, who shakes his head. Daenerys looks down sadly.

DAENERYS: She was Drogo's first gift to me.

JORAH: I remember.

DAENERYS: I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?

JORAH: A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

DAENERYS: Does it ever end?

JORAH: This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.

DAENERYS: And you're sure there's no other way?

JORAH: If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.

DAENERYS: No one will take my dragons.

JORAH: They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.

DAENERYS: (Turns to Jorah) As you are mine.

Daenerys says something in Dothraki, calling Rakharo and some others over. She then stands up, and addresses Rakharo and two others.

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.

RAKHARO: (Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.

Rakharo and the other two riders walk away. Later, as Rakharo is almost ready to leave, Daenerys approaches him.

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.

RAKHARO: (Speaking Dothraki) I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

DAENERYS: You never have.

RAKHARO: This is bad time to start.

Rakharo and the other two riders take off. Daenerys stares at the red comet, looking troubled.

CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL

EXT. WOODS

The large party of Nights Watchmen continue through the woods on horseback. Sam, Grenn, and Edd surround a sledge trapped in the snow on the side of the road.

JON: Having a rough time of it?

SAM: Nothing's killed me yet.

GRENN: Your ass killed the sledge.

SAM: You offered me a ride!

GRENN: I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.

The party reaches a large camp. Some of them dismount. The camera pans up to view a large wooden house in the center.

EDD: I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times.

The camera moves through the camp, to show some of the women working.

SAM: Are those girls?

EDD: Craster's daughters.

SAM: I haven't seen a girl in six months.

EDD: I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

GRENN: What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?

EDD: (Smirking) He don't like people messing with his wives.

Jon, Sam, and Grenn all look at Edd, surprised.

EDD: He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes.

SAM: That's foul.

GRENN: It's beyond foul.

EDD: All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.

JON: What happens to the boys?

SAM: Hmm?

JON: He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?

INT. CRASTERS LODGE

Craster, Mormont, and a number of watchmen sit around a fire.

LORD MORMONT: He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.

CRASTER: People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.

JON: (Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.

CRASTER: Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?

JON: Jon Snow.

CRASTER: Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.

LORD MORMONT: The lad meant no harm.

CRASTER: I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -

LORD MORMONT: No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

Jon takes a seat at the fire.

CRASTER: You bring any of that good wine with you?

LORD MORMONT: We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?

As the conversation continues, Jon looks around at some of Crasters daughters in the rafters.

CRASTER: I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

LORD MORMONT: There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.

WATCHMAN: Yes, commander.

CRASTER: You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.

LORD MORMONT: He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!

CRASTER: Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.

LORD MORMONT: He's been calling himself that for years. Whats he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

Craster looks at the watchman sitting next to Mormont and points.

CRASTER: That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?

LORD MORMONT: Give it here.

Mormont beckons to the watchman, who begrudgingly hands Mormont the axe.

LORD MORMONT: You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.

CRASTER: (Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.

LORD MORMONT: And where does he plan marching this army?

CRASTER: When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.

LORD MORMONT: These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.

CRASTER: Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

GILLY: This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.

CRASTER: Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?

LORD MORMONT: We chose different paths.

CRASTER: Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.

LORD MORMONT: (Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

CRASTER: (Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.

LORD MORMONT: Your roof, your rules.

The crows all leave the lodge.

EXT. IN THE CAMP

Mormont roughly grabs Jon and pins him against a wooden post.

LORD MORMONT: (Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?

JON: Lord commander.

LORD MORMONT: And who are you?

JON: Jon Snow.

LORD MORMONT: Who are you?

JON: Your steward.

LORD MORMONT: You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.

CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE

EXT. BEACH

The camera pans down from the red comet to Maester Cressen, holding a torch and running. Melisandre can be heard speaking in the distance.

MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods.

Cressen approaches a group gathered on the beach, burning some effigies. Melisandre is speaking to them.

MELISANDRE: Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.

THE GROUP: (In unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Cressen reaches the group and hands his torch to another man.

MELISANDRE: After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed.

CRESSEN: (To Davos) We need to stop her!

MELISANDRE: The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.

DAVOS: (Looks to Stannis) Not now.

MELISANDRE: And the dead shall rise in the North.

CRESSEN: (Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

After a long silence, Melisandre approaches Cressen and caresses his face.

MELISANDRE: You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.

After a moment, Cressen begrudgingly stands aside.

MELISANDRE: In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.

Stannis approaches one of the burning effigies as everyone else looks on. He pulls a sword out from the base and carries it high, to applause. When he sticks it in the sand, the crowd kneels.

CROWD: Lord, cast your light upon us!

MELISANDRE: For the night is dark and full of terrors.

STANNIS: For the night is dark and full of terror.

Stannis then walks away, almost forgetting to bring his wife with him. The rest of the crowd gets up to leave moments later. Davos and Cressen stay behind a moment to talk.

CRESSEN: This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.

DAVOS: Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.

CRESSEN: (Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.

DAVOS: I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

CRESSEN: As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth

DAVOS: What's the truth?

Cressen looks crestfallen. Davos walks away with the sword. Cressen looks up at the burning effigies.

INT. DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY

Matthos reads out a letter for Stannis to proofread, as they and some other characters sit around a table.

MATTHOS: And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-

STANNIS: He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me.

DAVOS: A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

STANNIS: A lie. Take it out.

Matthos scratches beloved off of the letter, and then continues.

MATTHOS: That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"

STANNIS: Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.

Matthos adds in the Kingslayer, and continues. Davos notices Cressen slip something into his own glass of wine.

MATTHOS: "And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"

STANNIS: Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

MATTHOS: (Adding Ser) "Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.

STANNIS: When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

DAVOS: Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -

STANNIS: I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.

DAVOS: Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

MELISANDRE: Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.

DAVOS: And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

MELISANDRE: He has no need for ships.

DAVOS: I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.

STANNIS: Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

CRESSEN: (Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?

DAVOS: (Whispers to Cressen) Don't.

Cressen stands up with the drugged glass of wine, and walks over to where Melisandre is sitting.

CRESSEN: A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

Melisandre stands up. Everyone at the table reaches for their own wine glasses. Cressen takes a sip of the drugged wine and offers it to Melisandre. Davos nervously watches her take the glass. Cressen begins to stumble and bleed from his nose. Melisandre drink a large portion of the wine. As he falls to the floor dead, Davos and many others stand up. Melisandre appears unphased by the poison.

MELISANDRE: The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.

CUT TO: NORTH

EXT. STARK CAMP

The camera pans over a watchtower to a wide shot of the camp. In the camp, Robb stark is led by a man with a torch to where Jaime is being held. Robb enters Jaimes cage, where he is tied to a wooden pole, a good distance from the walls of the cage.

JAIME: King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.

ROBB: If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.

JAIME: You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?

ROBB: Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.

JAIME: Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called boy? Insulted?

Robb looks behind Jaimes cage. As Jaime nervously strains to look behind him, Grey Wind can be heard heavily walking to the front of the cage.

ROBB: You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.

With Grey Wind now fully in view, Jaime loses his brave facade.

ROBB: You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.

JAIME: If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.

ROBB: My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.

JAIME: I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

ROBB: Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.

JAIME: You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?

ROBB: I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

JAIME: You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.

ROBB: No, but he's starting to know me.

JAIME: Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

ROBB: It's better than three defeats.

Robb nudges Grey Wind towards Jaime and leaves the cage. Grey Wind growls in Jaimes face and comes close to biting him. Jaime closes his eyes in preparation, but when he opens them back up, Grey Wind is gone.

INT. TYRIONS ROOM

Shae looks out from the balcony in Tyrions room.

SHAE: This city stinks Like dead bodies.

TYRION: A bit corpsey, yes.

SHAE: And shit.

Shae hops down from the balcony, and walks back into the room.

TYRION: I thought you wanted to come here.

SHAE: I love it.

TYRION: You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

SHAE: And cum and garlic and rum.

TYRION: You can smell cum from the balcony?

SHAE: I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.

TYRION: And so did the country.

Shae lays back on Tyrions bed.

SHAE: This is where I belong.

TYRION: Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.

SHAE: No one will know.

TYRION: You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.

SHAE: What about you?

TYRION: Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

SHAE: Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

TYRION: Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

TYRION: Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

Tyrion and Shae kiss as a bell rings in the distance.

INT. HALLWAY

A servant boy can be seen scrubbing something on the floor, as Baelish walks down a hallway next to a courtyard. Cersei and some kingsguard approach from behind.

CERSEI: Lord Baelish.

BAELISH: Your Grace.

CERSEI: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

BAELISH: Of course, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.

Baelish begins walking with Cersei and her guards.

BAELISH: If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.

CERSEI: And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.

BAELISH: Curious.

CERSEI: If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.

BAELISH: Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?

CERSEI: A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelishs shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?

BAELISH: Yes.

CERSEI: Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.

BAELISH: I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.

CERSEI: I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.

BAELISH: When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.

CERSEI: And which truth is that?

BAELISH: Knowledge is power.

CERSEI: Seize him. (Cerseis guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelishs neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.

Cersei walks away from Baelish, her guards following close behind. The servant boy scrubbing the floor looks up at Baelish.

CUT TO: NORTH

INT. ROBBS TENT

ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?

ALTON: I am, Your Grace.

ROBB: I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.

ALTON: An honorable request, Your Grace.

ROBB: Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.

Alton looks at him wide-eyed.

SER RODRIK: The King in the North.

THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE: King in the North.

ROBB: Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

ALTON: These are... Your Grace, these are...

ROBB: These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

ALTON: King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

ROBB: Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.

After everyone else leaves the tent, Theon approaches Robb.

THEON: A word, Your Grace?

ROBB: You don't have to call me Your Grace when no one's around.

THEON: It's not so bad once you get used to it.

ROBB: I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

THEON: The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?

ROBB: Of course they are.

THEON: We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.

ROBB: Men who fought my father.

THEON: Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.

INT. A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER

CATELYN: You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

ROBB: I need his ships. They say he has 200.

CATELYN: They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?

Catelyn is preparing to go somewhere, gathering up various items.

ROBB: I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

CATELYN: I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.

ROBB: Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.

CATELYN: I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.

ROBB: If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

CATELYN: You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?

ROBB: It's more complicated than that! You know it is.

A long pause follows. Catelyn sits down.

CATELYN: It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

ROBB: You can't go to Winterfell.

CATELYN: I beg your pardon?

ROBB: I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

CATELYN: Why in the name of all the Gods -

ROBB: Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.

CATELYN: I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -

ROBB: Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.

CATELYN: I will ride at first light.

Robb kisses Catelyns forehead, and they embrace.

ROBB: We will all be together again soon, I promise.

CATELYN: You've done so well. Your father would be proud.

ROBB: (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.

CATELYN: King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

INT. THRONE ROOM

Cersei and her guards enter the throne room. Extensive work is being done, overseen by Joffrey.

CERSEI: What is all this?

JOFFREY: Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.

CERSEI: We can't find Arya Stark.

JOFFREY: With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

CERSEI: Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.

JOFFREY: I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).

CERSEI: We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -

JOFFREY: The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

CERSEI: His life is in danger.

JOFFREY: We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.

CERSEI: Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.

JOFFREY: It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

CERSEI: Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -

JOFFREY: Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

CERSEI: What are you asking?

JOFFREY: I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

Cersei instinctively slaps Joffrey. It grows quiet as many workers look over at Joffrey and Cersei. Joffre looks up shocked, and then around to the workers in the room. Cersei appears nervous.

JOFFREY: What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother.

INT. BROTHEL

A man and a woman are having sex. The woman is shrieking loudly.

ROZ: No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.

The man and woman go back to having sex, this time with the woman slowly moaning.

ROZ: Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.

Roz walks Daisy through the brothel.

ROZ: We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

DAISY: Haystack Hall.

ROZ: Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.

DAISY: Littlefinger's a fancy man.

ROZ: Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.

As they enter a new room, a prostitute and two men with her get up to leave.

ROZ: She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

DAISY: She's beautiful.

ROZ: She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.

Janos is followed by a number of gold cloaks, some of whom are dragging along a prisoner. Some leave to search other rooms.

ROZ: You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.

JANOS: Orders.

ROZ: Whose orders?

JANOS: Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

MHAEGAN: No, you can't!

Some gold cloaks force Mhaegan and her baby, Barra, into the room. She begins crying. The prisoner looks at Barra, and back to Janos. He then nods. A gold cloak lets go of the prisoner and takes the Barra from Mhaegan.

MHAEGAN: No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.

The gold cloak holds a knife to the babys throat, hesitantly. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mhaegan continues begging for Barras life.

JANOS: Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.

After a moment, Janos takes out a knife and grabs the baby.

JANOS: Give it here.

Janos kills the baby just off screen, and Mhaegan shrieks. Janos and the other gold cloaks leave the brothel.

JANOS: Where is the bastard?

BLACKSMITH: The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

JANOS: Where?

BLACKSMITH: They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!

JANOS: How will we know him?

BLACKSMITH: He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.

JANOS: Find him.

TITLE SEQUENCE

Water can be heard trickling down. The opening shot is of Arya, her back to the camera, sitting by a pool of water in the woods. She turns her head to the left. Then some leaves rustle, and she turns to the right. A horse whinnies, and she walks towards some other people. Many of them are gathering wood, and she joins in. Jaqen Hghar, Rorge, and Biter watch her as she walks past their cage.

JAQEN: (Whispers) Boy.

Arya looks up at the cage.

JAQEN: (Whispers) Lovely boy.

ARYA: (Stops walking). What do you want?

JAQEN: A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.

ARYA: (Walks toward the cave). I have friends.

RORGE: Give us a beer. Before I skin you.

JAQEN: A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.

RORGE: Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!

Arya throws down the wood she was holding and looks at Rorge angrily.

ARYA: You should have asked nicely.

Arya begins hitting the cage with a stick, trying to hit Rorge. Rorge tries to claw back. Jaqen laughs at the exchange. Biter looks on.

RORGE: Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.

JAQEN: (Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.

RORGE: Come here!

Rorge reaches out at Arya. Gendry walks past holding wood. Arya joins him.

GENDRY: Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.

RORGE: Come here!

ARYA: They don't scare me.

GENDRY: Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.

Two gold cloaks ride in on horseback. Gendry puts down the wood he was carrying.

ARYA: What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?

Arya attempts to hide under some wood.

GENDRY: What are you doing?

ARYA: They're looking for me.

GOLD CLOAK: You're in command here?

YOREN: You're a long way from home.

GOLD CLOAK: I asked you a question.

YOREN: Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.

GOLD CLOAK: (Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.

Gendry looks at Arya. Arya looks back, pursing her lips.

YOREN: Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.

The gold cloak tries to pull out his sword. Yoren quickly pulls out his dagger and puts it to the mans leg.

YOREN: It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.

Yoren takes the gold cloaks sword. The other gold cloak pulls his out.

YOREN: We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

GOLD CLOAK: We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.

The gold cloaks ride off. Gendry and Arya stands up. Everyone in the party turns to look at Gendry.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

INT. RED KEEP

Tyrion walks through a room and into a hallway, whistling. As he opens the door to his room, Shae laughs, and he stops whistling. Shae and Varys are sitting at a table. Varys stands up, and Tyrion looks at Shae, and closes the door.

VARYS: My lord.

SHAE: You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.

VARYS: We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.

TYRION: It was quite a battle.

Tyrion walks over to the window to get some wine.

VARYS: I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

SHAE: And I tell him the story of how we meet.

VARYS: To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.

TYRION: (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.

SHAE: I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

VARYS: How can you tell?

SHAE: I can always tell.

TYRION: Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).

VARYS: I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.

TYRION: Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.

VARYS: How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shaes hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.

Shae stands up, and walks away. Tyrion puts his hand on the door, blocking it from being opened.

TYRION: I don't like threats.

VARYS: Who threatened you?

TYRION: I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.

VARYS: Ned Stark was a man of honor.

TYRION: And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.

VARYS: You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

Tyrion opens the door. He and Varys exit. Varys closes the door behind them.

INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER

The small council sits at their table. Alton stands nearby. Cersei is reading a letter aloud.

CERSEI: From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North. (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.

TYRION: You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.

CERSEI: You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

ALTON: I will, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?

Varys and Baelish look annoyed.

ALTON: I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

CERSEI: If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.

ALTON: I will, Your Grace.

TYRION: Safe travels, cousin.

Alton leaves the room, followed by two gold cloaks.

TYRION: You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

CERSEI: If that's everything?

PYCELLE: (Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.

Pycelle hands the letter to Tyrion, who unfurls it and begins reading.

VARYS: Trouble with the wildlings?

BAELISH: That's why they're called wildlings.

VARYS: Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

CERSEI: Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.

TYRION: Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.

CERSEI: Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.

TYRION: Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.

PYCELLE: The northerners are a superstitious people.

Everyone but Tyrion stands up to leave.

TYRION: According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie.

VARYS: How do you kill a dead man?

TYRION: Apparently you burn him.

CERSEI: One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys).

TYRION: I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.

CERSEI: I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

Everyone but Tyrion leaves.

CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL

INT. CRASTERS CAMP

Sam, Edd, and Grenn are standing at a table. Edd and Grenn are cutting food.

EDD: Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.

GRENN: We fart when we die?

EDD: My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

Edd makes farting noises with his mouth as they continue to cut food. Sam looks up and watches Gilly walk past.

SAM: Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?

EDD: We were having a serious discussion.

Grenn looks up to watch some of the women.

GRENN: Would you look at that.

SAM: Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.

GRENN: I prefer watching them come towards me.

SAM: I'm sure that's nice too.

GRENN: Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed.

SAM: You were with her? How many times?

GRENN: Well, as many times as I could.

SAM: Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

EDD: We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.

As Sam continues walking, a dog barks. Then a woman screams. Sam turns around to see Gilly backed up against a fence post. Ghost stands in front of her, eyeing the meat she is carrying. Sam begins slowly walking over.

SAME: No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! (Ghost walks away). (To Gilly)  You all right? Did he frighten you?

Sam reaches out to touch Gilly, but she flinches back.

GILLY: You shouldn't touch me.

SAM: Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause).

GILLY: You're very brave.

The camera moves to a shot of Jon sharpening his sword. He stops and looks up as Sam and Gilly approach him.

JON: Whatre you doing?

SAM: This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.

JON: Hello, Gilly. Whatre you doing?

GILLY: Sam said you could help.

JON: I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -

SAM: She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave.

JON: What? (Stands up).

SAM: I know it sounds a bit mad.

JON: No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.

SAM: The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -

JON: Sam we can't take her -

GILLY: Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.

JON: It's just not possible.

GILLY: I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I

JON: If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.

Gilly looks taken aback, and then runs off.

SAM: Why did you do that?

JON: Do what, ask her a question?

SAM: You were cruel.

JON: Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

SAM: I didn't touch her!

JON: No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

SAM: I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.

JON: We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

SAM: I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit.

JON: I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.

Jon sits back down, and returns to sharpening his sword. Sam walks away. When Sam is gone, Jon sighs deeply.

CUT TO: ESSOS

EXT. DESERT

The camera pans across Daeneryss people, many of whom appear tired and weak. Jorah and Daenerys sit near each other. After looking out for a few moments, Jorah takes a sip of his water, and then sighs. Then a horse can be heard approaching. Jorah looks up at it, and it is shown to be riderless.

JORAH: Khaleesi.

Daenerys looks up at the horse. Jorah gets up. The horse is covered in red paint. Jorah walks over to it. A soaking wet sack is attached to it. Some hair can be seen poking out of the top. Flies can be heard buzzing. Jorah feels the hair, and Daenerys gets up from where she was sitting to approach the horse. Jorah pulls the object in the sack out a little bit by the hair, revealing it to be a human head. He then puts it back in the sack. Jorah picks up the ponytail of the head, which has been cut off.

JORAH: You don't need to see this.

DAENERYS: He is blood of my blood.

Daenerys looks in the sack, and then quickly looks away.

DAENERYS: Who did this?

JORAH: Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.

DAENERYS: They will like it far less when I'm done with them.

Irri walks over and sees the head. She then falls to her knees, crying.

IRRI: No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

IRRI: (Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irris level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

Daenerys looks up at Jorah. Jorah looks down. Daenerys addresses Irri again, holding her head.

DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.

Daenerys continues to comfort Irri as she cries. Irri wails loudly.

CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS

EXT. BOAT

Theon stands on a boat, looking out at the Iron Islands. He smiles. The camera then cuts to him below deck. A naked woman lies in his bed. He walks towards the windows.

WOMAN: Is it as you remember my lord?

THEON: (Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.

WOMAN: Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.

THEON: (Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

WOMAN: Who will?

THEON: Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.

WOMAN: I love the cold and wet.

THEON: They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world.

WOMAN: Then you'll be king before long.

THEON: (Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better.

Theon stands up and roughly pushes her back onto the bed.

WOMAN: My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

THEON: (Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.

WOMAN: He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-

The woman groans as they begin having sex.

THEON: Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.

WOMAN: Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.

THEON: Your place is on this ship.

WOMAN: Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.

THEON: I haven't paid you.

Theon flips her over, and they continue having sex.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

INT. BROTHEL

A prostitute and a man are having sex. A man is watching them through a small hole, while he himself is getting a blowjob. He holds some keys in his hand, which are jingling as he pushes the prostitutes head. Baelish, in turn, is watching this man. He hears a noise and turns around, then covers the hole he was watching through. A man emerges from another room. A woman can be heard crying from inside.

MAN: I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.

BAELISH: One moment, my friend. A moment.

Baelish snaps his fingers, and a woman emerges from another room, covered only in gold jewelry. Out of sight, Baelish wipes some semen from her face with a cloth, and then turns back to the disgruntled man.

BAELISH: Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.

Upon seeing Ramka, the man smiles. As they begin to kiss passionately, Baelish goes to investigate the crying woman. He enters the room to see Roz, curled up on the bed, crying. He walks over to her, putting a hand on her back, and then sits next to her.

ROZ: Im sorry, my lord.

BAELISH: Shhh. Did he hurt you?

ROZ: No, my lord Its Mhaegen.

BAELISH: Who?

ROZ: She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.

BAELISH: Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.

ROZ: Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.

BAELISH: You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegens child. Ill see you tomorrow. But youll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy.

INT. DINING ROOM

PODRICK: More wine?

The scene begins zoomed in on Podrick pouring Janos a glass of wine. He then spills, and we see Tyrion and Janos sitting at a table.

JANOS: Damn it, boy!

PODRICK: Apologies, my lord.

TYRION: Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

JANOS: (Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.

TYRION: Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

JANOS: Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?

TYRION: You know your wines, my lord.

JANOS: That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.

TYRION: Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

JANOS: Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

TYRION:Wars have been started for less.

They both laugh. Janos sips his wine.

TYRION: I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

JANOS: Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.

TYRION: Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.

JANOS: Orders are orders.

TYRION: Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.

JANOS: I never said they were the queen's orders.

TYRION: No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.

JANOS: You know your sister better than I do.

TYRION: You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.

JANOS: I don't listen to filth.

TYRION: That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.

JANOS: Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine).

TYRION: I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.

When your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?

JANOS: I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.

TYRION: The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.

JANOS: Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.

TYRION: I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.

JANOS: You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.

TYRION: Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.

Tyrion gestures towards Bronn, who has appeared in the room.

TYRION: I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.

JANOS: What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -

TYRION: The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.

JANOS: We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.

TYRION: No, we shan't.

Tyrion nods at Bronn, who gestures for some armed men to enter the room.

TYRION: There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.

BRONN: The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

JANOS: These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

TYRION: His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.

BRONN: Boys?

The gold cloaks in the room escort Janos out. Janos begins shouting as they take him.

JANOS: I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!

Janos is escorted out of view. Bronn sits down, and Tyrion pours him a cup of wine.

TYRION: To the new Commander.

Tyrion and Bronn clink their glasses together. Then they both sip.

TYRION: If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?

BRONN: Without question? No. I'd ask how much.

Gendry gathers some water in a bucket. Lommy and Hot Pie sit next to the river, washing things. Arya sits away from them, doing the same.

LOMMY: If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.

HOT PIE: I'm not afraid of no battles.

ARYA: If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.

HOT PIE: I've seen lots of battles. I saw -

ARYA: Liar.

HOT PIE: I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.

LOMMY: Two men fighting isn't a battle.

HOT PIE: They had armor on.

ARYA: So?

HOT PIE: So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

LOMMY: No, it isn't.

HOT PIE: What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?

ARYA: (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

HOT PIE: (Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.

GENDRY: Now who told you that.

HOT PIE: A knight?

GENDRY: How'd you know he was a knight?

HOT PIE: Well, cause he got armor on.

GENDRY: You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).

HOT PIE: How'd you know?

GENDRY: Cause I sold armor.

Lommy nudges Hot Pie, and they both get up and leave. Arya stops washing and stands up, walking over to Gendry.

ARYA: What do the gold cloaks want with you?

GENDRY: (Turning around) No idea.

ARYA: You're a liar.

GENDRY: (Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.

ARYA: Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).

GENDRY:  Well, I dont care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions.

ARYA: No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?

GENDRY: How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?

ARYA: Who asked questions?

GENDRY: The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.

ARYA: Lord Stark.

GENDRY: See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.

ARYA: What did they ask about?

GENDRY: My mom.

ARYA: Who's your mom?

GENDRY: Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.

ARYA: And who was your father?

GENDRY: He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?

ARYA: I'm not a girl!

GENDRY: (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?

ARYA: Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.

GENDRY: That's true. You're still a girl.

ARYA: I am not!

GENDRY: Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.

ARYA: I don't need to take a piss Lommy and Hot Pie cant know. No one can know.

GENDRY: They won't. Not from me.

ARYA: My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

GENDRY: He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.

ARYA: He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.

GENDRY: So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

ARYA: No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -

GENDRY: You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.

ARYA: Do not call me milady.

GENDRY: As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike.

Arya pushes Gendry to the ground. He laughs, and she stomps off.

CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS

EXT. DOCKSThe scene starts with a wide shot of the busy docks. Theon stands in a rowboat as is comes up against the side of a wall. He gets out and walks up some stairs. An old man spots him.

MAN: What you carrying?

THEON: Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.

MAN: Don't like wine. Woman's drink. (Returns to his work).

THEON: I need to get to Pyke.

The man looks up, but makes no move or response. Theon looks annoyed and pulls out some coins.

MAN: I'll find you a horse.

The man takes the coins and walks away. Theon watches as the rowboat that took him there leaves. He looks down.

YARA: I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

THEON: I bet you can.

YARA: You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?

THEON: None like you.

YARA: You don't know what I'm like.

THEON: You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?

YARA: You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.

Yara and Theon pass the man as they are walking. He is leading a horse. Theon gives him some more coins.

THEON: Have my things sent up to the castle.

EXT. BEACH

Yara and Theon ride on horseback on a beach. Yara is at the reins.

THEON: You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.

YARA: Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?

THEON: Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.

YARA: Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.

THEON: I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.

YARA: Is that an offer from my future king?

THEON: An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.

YARA: I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.

As they approach the castle, the camera pans up to view it in its entirety.

INT. INSIDE PYKE

Balon sits in front of a fireplace. Theon enters the room.

THEON: Father.

BALON: Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?

THEON: A man. Your blood and your heir.

BALON: We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.

THEON: Lord Stark is gone.

BALON: And how do you feel about that?

THEON: What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

BALON: Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?

THEON: If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

BALON: It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?

THEON: Gold.

Balon reaches out and rips the bauble off. Theons cloak falls to the ground.

BALON: I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.

THEON: (Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.

BALON: Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.

THEON: The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

BALON: He heeds your counsel?

THEON: I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.

BALON: No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?

THEON: I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.

Theon holds a letter out. Balon takes it and turns around. He then unfurls it and reads it.

BALON: I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.

THEON: I will lead the attack myself.

BALON: Oh, you will?

THEON: I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?

Someone enters the room. Balon looks behind Theon, and he turns to look as well.

THEON: I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?

YARA: Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

BALON: (Puts his arm around her). My dear.

THEON: Yara?

YARA: So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.

THEON: She can't lead an attack!

BALON: And why not?

THEON: You're a woman!

YARA: You're the one in skirts.

BALON: This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.

ALL THREE: (Theon joins a little late). What's dead may never die.

The only night she's spent off these islands has been spent on the sea. She's commanded men. She's killed men. She knows who she is.

Balon leans down and burns the letter in the fire. Yara smirks at Theon.

BALON: (Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.

Balon walks away. Yara follows him. Theon turns around to watch them leave.

THEON: You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.

BALON:Who said anything about the Lannisters?

EXT. BEACH

Davos and Salladhor Saan walk on a beach. Matthos follows closely behind them..

DAVOS: You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

SAAN: All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?

DAVOS: Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.

SAAN: And yet, they both have larger armies.

DAVOS: Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.

SAAN: What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.

MATTHOS: Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking).

DAVOS: Matthos.

SAAN: You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.

DAVOS: Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.

SAAN: That's a promise that always comes true.

DAVOS: As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old.

SAAN: Only the clever ones.

DAVOS: You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.

SAAN: Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

DAVOS: It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).

SAAN: One thing, I want the queen.

DAVOS: The queen?

SAAN: Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.

MATTHOS: This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.

SAAN: I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.

MATTHOS: As if she would just let you!

SAAN: You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.

MATTHOS: Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.

SAAN: I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.

Matthos walks away angrily. Saan turns back to Davos.

SAAN: I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.

DAVOS: He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.

MATTHOS: You believe your king can win?

DAVOS: He is the one true king.

SAAN: You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.

DAVOS: Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.

They shake hands. Davos pats Saan on the back as he walks away. Saan and Matthos eye each other as Saan walks past. Matthos walks back over to his father.

MATTHOS: When will the King have a sail?

DAVOS: As soon as his God wills it.

MATTHOS: He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read.

DAVOS: Oh you and your mother.

MATTHOS: It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.

DAVOS: I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!

MATTHOS: But you always came home.

DAVOS: I wasn't praying.

MATTHOS: (They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.

DAVOS: You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.

MATTHOS: (As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

DAVOS: Don't tell him that.

Davos rides away and Matthos watches. In the background, Saans boat is in the water.

INT. TYRIONS ROOM

Tyrion sits at a table with a cup of wine. Cersei paces in front of him.

CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.

TYRION: I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

CERSEI: You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.

TYRION: Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?

CERSEI: Ha, the people. You think I care?

TYRION: You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, The Queen slaughters babies. (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it.

Cersei looks down and walks toward the window. Tyrion looks down, and then up at her.

TYRION: It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.

CERSEI: He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.

TYRION: I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.

CERSEI: I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me.

TYRION: (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.

CERSEI: You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.

TYRION: She was my mother too.

CERSEI: Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out).

Davos moves some ships around on a model map of Westeros as Matthos looks on. Stannis enters with Melisandre.

DAVOS: Your Grace.

MATTHOS: Your Grace.

STANNIS: How did it fare with your pirate?

DAVOS: Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.

STANNIS: In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

DAVOS: Does seem the wiser choice.

STANNIS: It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?

DAVOS: Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.
But once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops.

STANNIS: Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.

DAVOS: At once, Your Grace.

Davos walks away, followed by Matthos. As Matthos passes her, Melisandre stops him.

MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.

She then whispers something in his ear. When she is done, Matthos and Davos leave the room.

DAVOS: Come.

STANNIS: What did you say to him?

MELISANDRE: I told him death by fire is the purest death.

STANNIS: Why?

MELISANDRE: Because it is true. You're troubled my king.

STANNIS: Yeah.

MELISANDRE: These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.

STANNIS: Tell your lord to burn them then.

MELISANDRE: I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.

STANNIS: My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

MELISANDRE: You must have faith.

STANNIS: Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.

MELISANDRE: Then we must be the ten.

STANNIS: I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.

MELISANDRE: I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.

STANNIS: I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.

MELISANDRE: You must give... all of yourself.

Melisandre disrobes next to Stannis. He looks over and then looks away.

STANNIS: I have a wife. I took a vow.

MELISANDRE: She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King.

STANNIS: (Gasps). A son?

They begin kissing. Melisandre takes off what remained of her clothes. Stannis lays her on the table and they begin having sex, knocking many of the wooden models off of the table.

EXT. CRASTERS KEEP

Jon is sitting by a fire. He hears a noise and looks behind himself, seeing Craster walking away from the camp with a baby. Jon gets up to follow Craster and investigate, and walks into the woods. He begins hearing strange noises, and hides when he sees Craster walking back, without the baby. When Craster is out of sight, he runs in the direction Craster came from. He sees a figure lean down and pick up the baby. He is then startled by Craster, who puts his hand on Jons shoulder, and then knocks Jon out.

Jeor strides through camp until he finds Jon and Sam.

SAM: Lord Commander

JEOR: Leave us.

SAM leaves

JEOR: What did you do?

JON: I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

JEOR: What business is that of yours?

JON: No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys.

JEOR stares back mutely.

JON: You know.

JEOR: Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.

JON: Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.

JEOR: Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle

JON: I saw it. I saw something take that child.

JEOR: Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.

GILLY: I can't take it.

SAM: Please. I want you to. My mother She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

GILLY: You You shouldn't give it away.

INT. Winterfell.

Bran wakes from a dream to find Hodor and Summer in his room.

BRAN: Every night it's the same. I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.

LUWIN: That's exactly what they are, Bran, - stories.

BRAN: So she was lying? They don't exist?

LUWIN: Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.

BRAN: No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father And Rickon had the same dream.

LUWIN: What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.

Luwin shows his chain to Bran.

LUWIN: This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.

LUWIN tucks BRAN into bed.

LUWIN: All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

An exhibition fight between two armored knights (actually LORAS and BRIENNE) ensues, with RENLY and MARGAERY watching on. CATELYN and COLEN OF GREENPOOLS enter and watch from among the crowd. LORAS lands a solid blow.

MARGAERY: Loras! Highgarden!

MAN: Get him!

BRIENNE lifts LORAS and takes him to the ground, then draws a dagger to his face. MARGAERY stands nervously.

CROWD: Oh!

LORAS: Yield! I yield.

MARGAERY sits, disappointed.

RENLY: Well fought. Approach.

BRIENNE approaches first and kneels while LORAS looks on.

RENLY: Rise. Remove your helm.

BRIENNE removes her helm to reveal her identity to the crowd.

RENLY: You are all your father I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.

MARGAERY: Now, now, my love. My brother

RENLY: That he did, my queen But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.

BRIENNE: Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

RENLY: What?

The crowd gasps.

BRIENNE: I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.

RENLY: Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

The crowd applauds.

COLEN: Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord

CATELYN: Lordof Winterfell and King

RENLY: Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?

MARGAERY: You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.

CATELYN: You are most kind. My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

The crowd roars and Renly looks uncomfortable.

CATELYN: It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord. Your Grace.

BRIENNE: And you should kneel when you approach the King

RENLY: There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.

LORAS: Has your son

CATELYN: I do not sit on my son And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.

LORAS: If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother

CATELYN: My son

Renly chuckles, stands and walks to Catelyn.

RENLY: Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.

EXT. Renly's war camp

Renly and Catelyn walk side by side, with Brienne behind them. They encounter a man with a horse

GERARD: Your Grace.

RENLY: Gerard. How's your foot?

GERARD: Better, Your Grace. They don't know their own size is all.

RENLY: Good man.

They continue walking.

RENLY: I have 100,000 men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.

CATELYN: And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it?  I pity them.

RENLY: Why?

CATELYN: Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.

RENLY: Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.

BRIENNE: At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?

RENLY:  That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.

Renly departs. Brienne and Catelyn continue together.

BRIENNE: If you'll follow me, my lady.

CATELYN: You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

BRIENNE: I fought for my king Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.

INT. Throne room

Theon looks around the throne room. Yara appears from the shadows behind him.

THEON: What are you doing here?

YARA:I live here. Are you angry with me, brother

THEON: You lying bitch.

YARA: It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

THEON: Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy.

YARA: You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.

THEON: Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.

Balon enters.

BALON: The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

YARA: Father.

THEON: Father.

The look over a map of Westeros.

BALON: The wolf pup While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall. Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.

YARA: I've always wanted a castle.

THEON: And what's my role in all this?

BALON: You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

THEON: A ship? You give her 30 and I get one?

YARA:The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.

THEON: I'm to fight fishermen?

YARA: Be careful of their nets.

THEON: Father I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.

YARA: They won't even know we're there - until it's too late.

THEON: What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.

BALON: Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.

THEON: I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.

BALON: What are our words? Our words?

THEON: We do not sow.

BALON: We do not sow. We are ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.

THEON: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?

BALON slaps THEON, who falls back.

THEON: You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.

BALON exits.

YARA: You'd have our father bow down to your other family?

THEON: I have no other family.

YARA: Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.

Yara leaves.

Shae paces while Tyrion reads some parchment.

SHAE: You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me -

TYRION: Keep your voice down.

SHAE: Why? You think your father

TYRION: I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary.

SHAE: Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.

TYRION: But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.

SHAE: Scullion? What is a scullion?

TYRION: Kitchen wench.

SHAE: A kitchen wench?

TYRION: Yes, but

SHAE: Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion

TYRION: Your lion We've come to a dangerous place. My sister She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.

SHAE: I'm the weakness?

TYRION: It's a compliment, my lady.

SHAE: How is being a weakness a compliment?

TYRION: Language can be a bit tricky here.

SHAE: Oh. I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.

Shae strides away from Tyrion. Tyrion looks down, exasperated.

INT. Dining Hall

Cersei dines awkwardly with Sansa, Tommen and Myrcella.

MYRCELLA: When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

CERSEI: Soon, darling, when the war is over.

MYRCELLA: Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

CERSEI: The princess

SANSA: Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King

TOMMEN: Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

CERSEI: He might. Would you like that?

TOMMEN: No. I don't think so.

CERSEI: Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?

Sansa looks dejected.

INT. Sansa's chambers at night.

Sansa continues to look dejected, this time into her mirror. There is a knock at the door.

SANSA: Come in.

Shae enters.

SANSA: Who are you?

SHAE: I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

SANSA: I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.

SHAE: No.

They pause.

SANSA: What are you doing?

SHAE: Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

SANSA: I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.

SHAE: What things?

SANSA: Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

Shae closes the door and picks up a brush to comb Sansa's hair. Sansa stops her.

SANSA: No.

SHAE: You said to brush

SANSA: Not now.

SHAE: Your chamber pot is empty.

SANSA: Clean the table. Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

SHAE: Yes.

SANSA: For whom?

SHAE: Lady Zuriff.

SANSA: Lady Zuriff

SHAE: Lady Zuriff.

SANSA: There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

SHAE: She wasn't in this city.

SANSA: I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.

SHAE: Do you want me to leave?

SANSA: Just brush my hair.

Shae brushes her hair in silence.

INT. Tyrion's chambers, daytime.

Pycelle hands Tyrion some medicine.

TYRION: Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

PYCELLE: I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.

TYRION: Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

PYCELLE: Please. Thank you, my lord.

TYRION: I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

PYCELLE: Why, yes, of course, my lord.

TYRION: These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.

PYCELLE: Matrimony, huh? Yes.

TYRION: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.

PYCELLE: Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.

Tyrion walks to pour a drink.

TYRION: I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son

PYCELLE: Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

INT. Tyrion's chambers, daytime, though we do not realize at first that it is later.

TYRION: But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

VARYS: Ooh. "The Queen

TYRION: I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.

VARYS: Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.

TYRION: Precisely. Theon's father Greyjoycan destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father

INT. Tyrion's chambers, again we do not realize at first that it is later.

TYRION: But remember, you must tell no one.

LITTLEFINGER: Tell no one what?

TYRION: I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

LITTLEFINGER: She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her sona princess

TYRION: For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?

LITTLEFINGER: And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?

TYRION: Who better?

Littlefinger walks as he ponders.

LITTLEFINGER: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?

TYRION: The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King

LITTLEFINGER: Harrenhal is cursed.

TYRION: Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

LITTLEFINGER: With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.

TYRION: You served my family well in the matter of the succession.

LITTLEFINGER: So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.

TYRION: I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?

LITTLEFINGER: (Nods.)

TYRION: Good. Oh. And remember

LITTLEFINGER: The Queen

Tyrion drinks deeply and Littlefinger ponders.

INT. Renly's chambers at night

Renly and Loras are kissing passionately. Renly brings Loras to the bed and sits astride him. He removes his own shirt, kisses him and undoes his shirt. He sees the heavy bruising on Loras's chest.

RENLY: That must hurt.

Loras refuses to kiss him, pouting.

RENLY: What? What is it?

LORAS: A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

RENLY: Brienne is a very capable warrior. And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.

LORAS: Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.

RENLY: I'll make it up to you.

Renly moves to remove Loras's pants.

LORAS: No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father

Renly lies down, dejected, but then decides to try to seduce Loras one more time. Loras resists.

LORAS: Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

RENLY: And Margaery's a virgin?

LORAS: Officially. Shall I bring her to you?

LORAS leaves the bed to get his sister.

INT. Renly's chambers, a bit later.

Renly pours and drinks some wine. Margaery enters.

RENLY: I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.

MARGAERY: As is your right. You are a king

RENLY: You look very beautiful.

MARGAERY: Thank you, Your Grace.

RENLY: It's a lovely gown.

MARGAERY: You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.

MARGAERY removes her gown. Renly pauses, embarrassed.

RENLY:  You certainly don't need it.

MARGAERY starts kissing RENLY, but he resists and continues talking.

RENLY: Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.

MARGAERY hushes him and begins kissing again. She reaches to his groin, but is disappointed by his lack of excitement.

RENLY: Must be the wine.

MARGAERY: Here, let me.

She undoes his pants and tries to excite him.

RENLY: I'm sorry.

MARGAERY: Do you want my brother

RENLY: What?

MARGAERY: He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.

RENLY: I don't know what you're talking about.

MARGAERY: There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.

She sits next to him on the bed.

MARGAERY: Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a king

Renly sighs.

INT. Cersei's chambers, at night

CERSEI: You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

TYRION: Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.

CERSEI: I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

TYRION: Dorne is the safest place for her.

CERSEI: Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

TYRION: That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son

CERSEI: She'll be a hostage.

TYRION: A guest.

CERSEI: You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

TYRION: It's done, Cersei.

CERSEI:  No.

TYRION:  You cannot stop it.

CERSEI sweeps glassware from the table in frustration. It shatters.

CERSEI:  No!

TYRION: Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.

CERSEI: Get out! Get out!

She moves to strike Tyrion, who recoils. Cersei turns, sits and weeps. Tyrion exits.

PRIEST: Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

THEON: I would.

DROWNED PRIEST:  Kneel.

Theon kneels.

DROWNED PRIEST: Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.

THEON: What is dead may never die.

DROWNED PRIEST: What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.

Tyrion sits and ponders. Littlefinger enters, enraged.

LITTLEFINGER: I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy

TYRION: No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

LITTLEFINGER: And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.

TYRION: Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

LITTLEFINGER: Leave me out of your next deception.

TYRION: That's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.

LITTLEFINGER: Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.

TYRION: No, he won't. But his mother How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?

BRONN enters.

TYRION: Find him?

BRONN: Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

TYRION: No, you don't.

BRONN: No, I don't.

INT. Brothel

Pycelle and a prostitute lie on a bed. She is naked, while he is fully clothed. The door bursts open as Bronn and  TIMETT walk in. The woman flees the bed, and Pycelle sits up in indignation.

PYCELLE: What is the meaning of this? No, please, please.

TYRION stands in the doorway.

TYRION: You disappoint me, Grand Maester

PYCELLE: I am your loyal servant.

TYRION: So loyal that you told the Queen

PYCELLE: No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.

TYRION: See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.

PYCELLE: The eunuch

TYRION: Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

PYCELLE: No, no, no.

TIMETT: There are no goats, halfman.

TYRION: Well, make do.

PYCELLE recoils from TIMETT while BRONN smiles.

TYRION: How long have you been spying for my sister

PYCELLE: All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.

TYRION: I don't like his beard.

PYCELLE: What? What?

BRONN grabs PYCELLE by the beard, then chops it off with a large knife.

PYCELLE: No. No.

TYRION: How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

PYCELLE: Lord Arryn, he knew. He knew the truth about the Queen And he planned to act, to tell King Robert.

TYRION: So you poisoned him?

PYCELLE: No. Never.

TYRION: But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.

PYCELLE: Lannister I always served Lannister.

TYRION: Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.

BRONN and TIMETT wrestle Pycelle out of the room.  Pycelle: No. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!

TYRION leaves a coin on the chair for the prostitute, who looks appears to be in shock.

TYRION: For your trouble.

The struggle continues, so TYRION decides to double his payment in compensation. The prostitute nods meekly.

INT. TYRION'S CHAMBERS

Varys and Tyrion sit at table. Varys drinks some wine.

VARYS: You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.

TYRION: Good. One of my better ideas.

VARYS: And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle. The Small Council grows smaller every day.

TYRION: The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

VARYS: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?

TYRION: Why, am I about to hear one?

VARYS: Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?

TYRION: Depends on the sellsword.

VARYS: Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.

TYRION: He has a sword, the power of life and death.

VARYS: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner

TYRION: I've decided I don't like riddles.

VARYS: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.

They both drink.

YOREN: You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.

ARYA: I can't sleep.

YOREN offers her his wineskin.

ARYA: I don't like the taste.

YOREN: You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest. What?

ARYA: How do you sleep?

YOREN: Same as most men, I think.

ARYA: But you've seen things, horrible things.

YOREN: Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.

ARYA: How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head?

YOREN: You didn't see that. I made damn sure.

ARYA: I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queenand and my sister

YOREN thinks for a bit.

YOREN: You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?

Horn blasts ring out from outside. Yoren rises quickly in response.

YOREN: Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.

GENDRY: Get up.

ARYA: Get up.

YOREN: Keep out of sight, both of you.

ARYA:  No, I'm not afraid.

GENDRY: I can fight.

YOREN: Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back. Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!

MAN: Come on, move, move!

EXT. Gold cloaks ride up to challenge the Night's Watch recruits.

MAN: Gold cloaks!

MAN: Everyone out!

MAN: Hey, you!

MAN: Open the damn cage!

AMORY: Where's the bastard, crow?

YOREN: Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?

AMORY: Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

YOREN: Now, which king would that be?

AMORY: This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.

YOREN: I don't think I will.

AMORY: So be it.

A gold cloak shoots Yoren with a crossbow. He falls, but then rises in anger.

YOREN: I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.

YOREN battles the gold cloaks, and takes down a few of them before being subdued. Amory Lorch rides over and pierces Yoren with his sword, killing him. The recruits flee.

JAQEN: Boy, come here. Boy! - Sweet boy

The cage containing the JAQEN, BITER and RORGE is about to catch fire. ARYA pauses, not sure of what to do. The gold cloaks set upon the recruits in battle.

JAQEN: Come back here! Help us, boy

ARYA spies an axe and runs to retrieve it. She comes over to the cage.

JAQEN: Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that.

The battle continues. Hot Pie watches from the bushes, but the recruits are outmatched.

GOLD CLOAK: Put them on the wagon!

GOLD CLOAK #2: There's more here.

GOLD CLOAK #3: Come on.

ARYA tries to run from the encampment. POLLIVER comes from the darkness, punches her in the face and she falls to the ground.

POLLIVER: What do we have here?

He takes Arya's sword.

ARYA: No!

POLLIVER: That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

Hot Pie is pushed forward by soldiers, encountering Arya, still on the ground.

HOT PIE: I yield! I yield!

AMORY: Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

POLLIVER: You heard him. You're coming with us.

HOT PIE: I yield!

They walk back to camp and come across a wounded LOMMY with a crossbow bolt in his leg.

LOMMY: Help! Help me!

POLLIVER: Something wrong with your leg, boy?

LOMMY: Look at it.

POLLIVER: Can you walk?

LOMMY: No. You got to carry me.

POLLIVER: All right.

He stabs the LOMMY instead. LOMMY spits up blood, and dies.

POLLIVER: "Carry him," he says.

AMORY: We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.

No one says anything. Then Arya gets an idea. She nods over to the slain LOMMY.

ARYA: You want Gendry? You already got him. He loved that helmet.
EXT. OUTSIDE OXCROSS

Thunder rumbles through the darkness. It is raining at the gold cloak encampment. Two gold cloaks are arguing over who is the best fighter.

GUARD #1: It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.

RENNICK: Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

GUARD #1: If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.

RENNICK: If he ever gets out.

GUARD #1: Loras Tyrell?

RENNICK: Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.

GUARD #1: I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.

RENNICK: How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.

They laugh, and a horse neighs nervously.

RENNICK: The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.

GUARD #1: They get spooked by their own shadows.

RENNICK: Shh. Do you hear that?

GUARD #1: No.

RENNICK: There's something out there.

The soldiers both stand to investigate the darkness. They move forward cautiously, until RENNICK lets out a loud fart. GUARD #1 jumps, and RENNICK laughs raucously.

GUARD #1: Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face.

RENNICK: I swear you pissed yourself. "Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

GUARD #1: There is something out there.

RENNICK: Yeah, don't even try me.

GUARD #1: Rennick.

RENNICK: Do you think I'm an idiot?

GUARD #1: Rennick!

GUARD #1 draws his sword. A direwolf leaps from the darkness and attacks RENNICK. The camera focuses on ROBB's face in the darkness as RENNICK screams. ROBB and his northern men sit quietly on their horses, listening as a pack of wolves descends upon the Lannister men.

MAN: King in the North!

MEN: The King in the North!

EXT. The battlefield, the next morning.

The northern forces have completed their assault on the emcampment. The camera pans across bodies and wounded men in the mist. Horses niegh and soldiers cry out in pain. ROOSE and ROBB walk through the aftermath, followed by a handful of northern soldiers.

ROOSE: Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.

ROBB: We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

ROOSE: Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.

ROBB: I doubt it.

ROOSE: Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets. "A flayed man none."

ROBB: My father outlawed flaying in the North.

ROOSE: We're not in the North.

ROBB: We're not torturing them.

ROOSE: The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.

ROBB: The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.


WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, don't! Don't! Please!

TALISA: Shhh

A WOUNDED SOLDIER struggles as TALISA removes his tattered pants and tries to tend his bloody legs while another woman tries to help.

TALISA: The rot's set in.

WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, don't! No, don't!

TALISA: Shh.

WOUNDED SOLDIER: Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.

TALISA: The rot will spread. If we don't take the foot now

WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, you can't!

ROBB approaches, looking concerned as he struggles. ROBB kneels and holds the man down.

WOUNDED SOLDIER: Ser! Please, ser.  I can't lose

ROBB: You'll die if she doesn't.

WOUNDED SOLDIER: I don't want to be a cripple, please.

ROOSE: Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.

TALISA: Your men are not my men, my lord.

ROBB: Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.

WOUNDED SOLDIER:  No! You can't!

ROBB: Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.

ROBB holds the WOUNDED SOLDIER down as TALISA saws off his foot. He screams through the gag that ROBB placed in his mouth. Robb watches the resigned TALISA saw through, impressed by her resolve.

CUT TO: Another part of the battleflield.


A mounted soldier rides slowly, carrying the Stark banner. TALISA readies the cart, carrying a wounded man. It starts forward, and TALISA looks exhausted. ROBB looks over at her. She notices, and turns. ROBB approaches.

ROBB: What's your name?

TALISA: Talisa.

ROBB: Your last name?

TALISA: You want to know what side my family fights on?

ROBB: You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.

TALISA: That boy lost his foot on your orders.

ROBB: They killed my father.

TALISA: That boy did?

ROBB: The family he fights for.

TALISA: Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

ROBB: I have no hatred for the lad.

TALISA: That should help his foot grow back.

TALISA walks away in frustration, carrying a heavy pail. ROBB follows.

ROBB: You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.

TALISA: You're going to kill Joffrey?

ROBB: If the gods give me strength.

TALISA: And then what?

ROBB:  I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

TALISA: So who will?

ROBB:  I don't know.

TALISA: You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?

ROBB: First we have to win the war.

Frustrated, TALISA climbs onto a horse's cart, and signals it to start off.

ROBB: You never told me where you're from.

TALISA: Volantis.

ROBB:  Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.

TALISA: He was unlucky that you were.

TALISA rides away, and they both watch one another as she gets further and further away.

EXT. KING'S LANDING

INT. THRONE ROOM

JOFFREY aims a crossbow at a kneeling SANSA while the HOUND stands by.

JOFFREY: You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.

SANSA: Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please

JOFFREY: Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

LANCEL address the room, which is taken aback by his recounting.

LANCEL: Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.

JOFFREY: Killing you would send your brother a message.

SANSA: (Cries.)

JOFFREY: But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.

MERYN TRANT approaches SANSA.

JOFFREY: Leave her face. I like her pretty.

SANSA looks aghast at JOFFREY. MERYN punches her full-force in the stomach and she doubles over in pain. JOFFREY looks on cruelly as MERYN cuts SANSA's legs out from under her. She falls to the floor, wailing.

JOFFREY: Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her.

MERYN rips SANSA's dress from the back. She cries in anguish.

JOFFREY: If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.

MERYN raises his sword to hit SANSA.

TYRION: What is the meaning of this?

MERYN holds, while TYRION and BRONN enter the throne room. JOFFREY looks worried.

TYRION: What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

MERYN: The kind who serves his king, Imp.

BRONN: Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.

TYRION: Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?

JOFFREY: I'm punishing her.

TYRION: For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.

JOFFREY: You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!

TYRION: The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?

MERYN: No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.

TYRION: I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?

MERYN stares daggers at TYRION. TYRION approaches SANSA and offers his hand. She takes it and stands. They walk out together.

TYRION: I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?

SANSA: I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.

TYRION: Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

TYRION watches SANSA walk out of the chamber, in admiration of her strength and clever response.

BRONN: The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.

TYRION: You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?

BRONN: There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.


CUT TO: INT. CASTLE.

The HOUND stands in the hallway. JOFFREY enters.

JOFFREY: What are you doing here, dog?

HOUND: Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.

JOFFREY: And? What is it?

HOUND: Look inside, Your Grace.

INT. JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS

JOFFREY enters his chambers to find ROS and DAISY waiting for him.

DAISY: Your Grace.

ROS: Happy nameday, Your Grace.

JOFFREY: My nameday has passed.

ROS: We won't tell if you won't.

She moves to remove Joffrey's pants. He rebuffs her.

JOFFREY: No. Her. Touch her.

ROS undresses DAISY, who stands upon a table. They both giggle, and the second prostitute begins to kiss and fondle the other's stomach. JOFFREY watches, intrigued.

JOFFREY: Could you hit her?

They giggle, and the first prostitute comes down to the floor and presents her ass. The second prostitute spanks her playfully.

JOFFREY: My uncle sent you?

DAISY: Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

ROS: Hmm.

JOFFREY comes closer and presents his large belt to ROS.

JOFFREY: Use this.

ROS hesitates, but takes it. She swings firmly, and ROS reacts, surprised but still enjoying the pain.

JOFFREY: Harder.

DAISY looks worried. ROS hits her with more force, and she cries in pain. DAISY seems disgusted with herself. JOFFREY grabs her chin, roughly.

JOFFREY: I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.

ROS nods meekly. JOFFREY steps away. The spanking begins agian, harder than before. DAISY screams in pain. After multiple spankings, DAISY scrambles onto the bed, crying. Joffrey presents a mace to DAISY, who takes it.

ROS: Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.

JOFFREY cranks his crossbow. DAISY whimpers and shakes her head in fear. JOFFREY finishes setting the bow.

DAISY:  Please, Your Grace.

ROS: Your Grace, if your uncle finds out

JOFFREY: Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.

JOFFREY threatens her with the loaded crossbow. She pauses.

JOFFREY: Begin.

DAISY begins to cry, and then ROS commences the painful beating with the mace, and the other girl responds with screams of agony.

JOFFREY: Harder!

EXT: The Shadowlands

RENLY's war camp is bustling. He walks up to LITTLEFINGER, who awaits him.

RENLY: Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.

RENLY: Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?

LITTLEFINGER: I'm a practical man.

RENLY: Just not a loyal one.

LITTLEFINGER: And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?

RENLY: I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?

LITTLEFINGER's eyes shift to BRIENNE.

RENLY: You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.

LITTLEFINGER: You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.

RENLY takes an apple and sits down.

RENLY: Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head.

LITTLEFINGER: I would give priority to my head.

RENLY: (snorts)

LITTLEFINGER: I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.

RENLY ponders LITTLEFINGER's implications.

CUT TO: The war camp at night.

LITTLEFINGER stands my a fire, warming himself. LORAS and MARGAERY appreach. LORAS peels off into a nearby tent while MARGAERY walks past LITTLEFINGER. He follows her.

LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.

MARGAERY: Lord Baelish.

LITTLEFINGER: All of these tents look the same to me. -Would you be so kind

MARGAERY: It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.

LITTLEFINGER: "Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.

MARGAERY: I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.

LITTLEFINGER: If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.

MARGAERY: The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.

LITTLEFINGER: And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?

MARGAERY: You seem quite interested in our marriage.

LITTLEFINGER: Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.

MARGAERY: You've never married, have you?

LITTLEFINGER: I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

MARGAERY: That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

MARGAERY walks away and LITTLEFINGER bows in respect, then ponders.



EXT. OUTSIDE QARTH

A lone horseman, KOVARRO, rides trots through the desert towards DAENERYS, who looks lethargic and desperate.

DAENERYS: (Valerian) This isn't your horse.

KOVARRO dismounts.

KOVARRO: (Valerian) It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.

DAENERYS: (Valerian) Qarth?

KOVARRO: (Valerian) Three days to the east, on the sea.

DAENERYS: (Valerian) Will they let us in?

KOVARRO: (Valerian) They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.

DAENERYS turns to JORAH.

DAENERYS: What do you know of this place?

JORAH: Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.



EXT. THE RIVERLANDS

ARYA, GENDRY, HOT PIE and the other Night's Watch recruits are being led towards a misted, ruined Castle. There are groans and screams of pain as the recruits walk, their hands bound.

MAN #3: Go on!

MAN #4: You, keep moving!

MAN: Bring her about!

HOT PIE: What kind of fire melts stone?

ARYA: Dragon fire.

HOT PIE: There's dragons here?

GENDRY: No, all the dragons are dead.

HOT PIE: What's that smell?

ARYA: Dead people.

SOLDIER: Move.

EXT. PRISONER ENCAMPMENT

Some prisoners are in chains. There are more screams of pain and the prisoners look dejected. Sounds of torture can be heard in the distance while ARYA, GENRY and HOT PIE listen in horror.

MAN: Please, please, no, no! No.

There is a cranking of chains, then a thud. The screaming has stopped.

WOMAN: He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that.

GENDRY: They take someone every day?

WOMAN : (nods)

ARYA: Does anyone live?

The WOMAN does not answer, and ARYA looks down, hopelessly. She and GENDRY share a glance.

EXT: PRISONER ENCAMPMENT AT NIGHT

It is nighttime and raining. ARYA lies in the mud.

ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.

EXT. THE SHADOWLANDS

CATELYN sits in her tent. LITTLEFINGER enters, and she rises.

CATELYN: How dare you?

LITTLEFINGER: You may have heard false reports.

CATELYN: You betrayed Ned.

LITTLEFINGER: Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.

CATELYN:I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.

LITTLEFINGER: No, my lady.

CATELYN: Get out!

LITTLEFINGER: Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance

CATELYN draws a knife, threateningly. LITTLEFINGER pauses, thinking.

CATELYN: Have you lost your mind? Get out!

LITTLEFINGER: Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?

CATELYN: You have Arya, too?

LITTLEFINGER: Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.

CATELYN ponders, then lowers the knife and places it down.

CATELYN: What do you want?

LITTLEFINGER: The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.

CATELYN: Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.

LITTLEFINGER: I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.

CATELYN: You think I keep secrets from my son?

LITTLEFINGER: Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.

CATELYN: I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.

Two servants enter and place down something heavy.

CATELYN: Good faith?

The servants bow and leave. CATELYN looks ashenly at LITTLEFINGER as she comes to realize what is in the chest before her.

CATELYN: What's this?

CATELYN kneels slowly over the chest and opens it. She looks down, sadly.

LITTLEFINGER: Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe

CATELYN: Get out.

Speechless, LITTLEFINGER leaves. CATELYN begins to cry. She slams the chest closed.

EXT: RIVERLANDS PRISONER ENCAMPMENT

ARYA sleeps on the cold, wet ground. Soldiers wake up the prisoners with banging and shouting.

MAN: Get up, you dogs!

The recruits stand up as the soldiers move through the camp. The MOUNTAIN strides into camp.

HOT PIE: That's him, the one who picks.

ARYA: The Mountain. What are you doing?

HOT PIE: He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.

The MOUNTAIN looks over the crowd. Most people look down, but HOT PIE meets his gaze, as does another PRISONER. The MOUNTAIN picks that PRISONER.

MOUNTAIN: You.

SOLDIER: Move, boy! Move!

HOT PIE is shocked and pisses himself for having listened to the other man.

EXT. TORTURE AREA

The PRISONER is strapped into a chair, his neck and extremities bound. Panic fills his eyes as they tighten the straps and the TICKLER begins his inquisition.

TICKLER: Is there gold and silver in the village?

PRISONER: I don't know.

TICKLER: Gems?

PRISONER: I didn't see any.

TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?

PRISONER: I don't know.

The TICKLER gives permission to begin the torture. A SOLDIER pulls out a squealing rat and places it into a bucket. The PRISONER's panic rises.

TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?

PRISONER: I don't know. Please.

TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?

PRISONER: I don't know.

The SOLDIER attaches the bucket to the PRISONER's chest.

TICKLER: Which of the villagers aided them?

PRISONER:I don't know.

TICKLER: Who?

PRISONER: I -

The TICKLER nods to the SOLDIER, who pulls a flaming torch out of the fire.

TICKLER: Who?

PRISONER: I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to

The rat start to chew on the PRISONER's chest. His eyes widen in pain and panic.

TICKLER:  Who?

PRISONER: I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!

TICKLER: Who helped him?

PRISONER:  Ganes, the butcher, - and his son.

TICKLER:  That's better.  You've been very helpful.

PRISONER: No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!

The SOLDIER holds the flame to the bucket, and the rat trapped inside shrieks in constant fear.

PRISONER: No! No! I told you everything! No! No!

The TICKLER looks on without pity.



INT. PRISONER ENCAMPMENT

ARYA lies in the dark as rain falls.

ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.

WOMAN: Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread.

POLIVER punches the WOMAN and she collapses, crying. He then continues walking.

ARYA: Polliver. The Mountain.

EXT. STORMLANDS

RENLY's bannermen sit astride their horses on a cliffside, next to the sea. A strong wind blows. The camera zooms in to show a meeting of the Baratheon Brothers: RENLY, CATELYN, LORAS and BRIENNE facing STANNIS, DAVOS and MELISANDRE


STANNIS: Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.

CATELYN: I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

RENLY: Can that truly be you?

STANNIS: Who else might it be?

RENLY: When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?

STANNIS: My own.

RENLY: I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?

MELISANDRE: The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

RENLY: Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.

STANNIS: Watch yourself, Renly.

RENLY: No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.

MELISANDRE: You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.

RENLY: Born amidst salt and smoke? - Is he a ham?

STANNIS: That's twice I've warned you.

CATELYN: Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.

STANNIS: It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.

CATELYN: We share a common enemy.

STANNIS: The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.

RENLY: The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power.

STANNIS: For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.

RENLY quickly considers the offer.

RENLY: Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?

STANNIS: You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?

RENLY: No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.

STANNIS: We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.

MELISANDRE: Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors.

STANNIS and his party ride off.

RENLY: Would you believe I loved him once?

RENLY spurs his mount and his party heads in the opposite direction.

EXT. THE GATES OF QARTH

DAENERYS and her Dothraki sit outside the gates of Qarth. The gates are closed.

DAENERYS: I thought we were welcome.

JORAH: If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.

DAENERYS: Horde?

QARTH soldiers line up outside the gate, at attention. A group of thirteen emissaries from the city walk forward from the gates. A plump SPICE KING leads the group.

DAENERYS: My name is Daenerys

SPICE KING: Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

DAENERYS: You know me, my lord?

SPICE KING: Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons.

DAENERYS: And what should I call you?

SPICE KING: Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.

DAENERYS:  The beauty of Quarth is legendary

SPICE KING Qarth.

DAENERYS:  Qarth.

SPICE KING: Might we see the dragons?

DAENERYS looks back to the woven chest that holds the dragons on top of one of their horses. She is nervous, and a bit desperate.

DAENERYS: My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored

SPICE KING: Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

DAENERYS:  I am not a liar.

SPICE KING: Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

DAENERYS: Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.

SPICE KING: Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.

The SPICE KING turns and walks away. DAENERYS steps follows with indignation, and he turns back around.

DAENERYS: What are you doing? You promised to receive me.

SPICE KING: We have received you. Here we are, and here you are.

DAENERYS:  If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

SPICE KING: Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

The SPICE KING continues to the thirteen, and they begin their walk back into Qarth.

JORAH: Khaleesi, please be careful.

DAENERYS finds her resolve and steps forward. The soldiers react by leaning their spears forward in unison, clearly a warning.

DAENERYS: Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.

The SPICE KING steps forward from the thirteen.

SPICE KING:  Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so

XARO XHOAN DAXOS steps out from the back of the Thirteen.

XARO: Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.

SPICE KING: The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken.

XARO: I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.

SPICE KING:  The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?  She is the Mother of Dragons.

XARO: Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.

DAENERYS recognizes that XARO is a potential ally, but the SPICE KING remains resolute.

SPICE KING:  Our decision is final.

XARO: Very well. I invoke soumai.

The Thirteen react, looking between themselves. XARO draws his dagger, pointing downward and grabs the blade with his left hand. DAENERYS looks to JORAH for council.

XARO: I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

XARO pulls the dagger up, slicing his palm deeply. He displays the wound to the Thirteen.

SPICE KING: Be it on your head.

XARO: Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

The SPICE KING rejoins the Thirteen in frustration. XARO gestures a welcome to DAENERYS, and the gates open, noisily. DAENERYS and JORAH share a glance before the Dothraki band walk through the city gates. XARO joins her side.


EXT. THE RIVERLANDS

EXT. A COURTYARD

A soldier mounts the head of the tortured PRISONER on a spike and decends a ladder.  The night's watch recruits are still captive in the ruined building. They hand their heads in subjugation, trying not to be noticed.

MOUNTAIN: (to Gendry) You.

GRENDRY and ARYA look at one another in panic. Soldiers grab GENDRY, and he is bound in the torture chair.

TICKLER: Is there gold or silver in the village?

GENDRY: I'm not from the village.

TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?

The TICKLER sits, facing GENDRY while his SOLDIER stands menacingly at his side.

GENDRY: I don't know what that is.

ARYA stares. The TICKLER nods to his helper to take action. The camera pans across the sullen crowd, including ARYA and HOT PIE. The  SOLDIER places a rat in a bucket and straps it to GENDRY'S chest.

CUT TO: ANOTHER COURTYARD IN THE RUINED CASTLE

TYWIN rides in, astride a white horse and flanked by gold coats. He looks around in disappointment. He is greeted by the MOUNTAIN.

MAN: You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

TYWIN: What's this?

TYWIN dismounts while a soldiers takes the reigns of his horse. He then walks forward, inspecting the prisoners and their condition.

MOUNTAIN: We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

TYWIN: Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

MOUNTAIN: Cells are overflowing, my lord.

POLLIVER: This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just

TYWIN: Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?

He gets no response. TYWIN continues to inspect the prisoners, and addresses GENDRY.

TYWIN: You, do you have a trade?

ARYA sits, expressionless, trying not to be noticed.

GENDRY: Smith, my lord.

POLLIVER notices ARYA's attention, and feels slighted. He draws his sword to threaten her.

POLLIVER: What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

ARYA backs away, and TYWIN intervenes.

TYWIN: He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?

ARYA: Safer to travel, my lord.

TYWIN: Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.

MOUNTAIN: My lord.


EXT.KING'S LANDING

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.

TYRION answers the knocking on his door to find LORAS.

TYRION: Your visits are too few, cousin.

LORAS: Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant.

LORAS extends a scroll to TYRION, who takes it, unimpressed.

TYRION:  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

TYRION steps into his chamber and pours himself a cup of wine.

LORAS: I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.


TYRION: If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself.
Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?

LORAS: I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.

LORAS moves to leave, but TYRION does not let him.

TYRION: And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?

LORAS: As I said several times.

TYRION: And you've waited this long to deliver the information?

LORAS: When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.

TYRION ponders the scroll, while LORAS stands over his desk, annoyed.

TYRION: Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.

LORAS thinks carefully before responding.

LORAS: The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.

TYRION: She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.

As TYRION walks past LORAS, he catches a familiar aroma.

TYRION:  Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

LORAS: I am a knight!

TYRION: An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?

LORAS: You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

TYRION: Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?

LORAS sits, and chokes out some frustration.

LORAS: It's not my fault!

TYRION: Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?

LORAS: Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.

TYRION: Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

LORAS: I only meant I did as I was bid.

TYRION: Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

TYRION moves to leave the chamber to fetch JOFFREY. LORAS falls to his knees and begs.

LORAS: Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.

TYRION:  Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

LORAS: My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

TYRION: No, I think not.

LORAS: My lord?

TYRION: You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.

LORAS: Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command.

TYRION claps in celebration.

TYRION: Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.

LORAS: But her demands?

TYRION: Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

LORAS: You will?

TYRION: Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.

TYRION shuts the chamber door. LORAS leans against the wall, feeling beaten.

EXT. THE STORMLAND SEA AT NIGHT

A boat with a stag figurehead rocks on the calm seas. DAVOS approaches STANNIS on the deck.

DAVOS: Your Grace.

STANNIS: Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

DAVOS: Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.

STANNIS: Fewer.

DAVOS: Pardon?

STANNIS: Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.

DAVOS: It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.

STANNIS: You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.

DAVOS: A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

STANNIS: Does he listen?

DAVOS: To me? Gods, no. But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest

STANNIS: She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.

DAVOS: I've lived within the law for 17

STANNIS: I want you to be a smuggler this time.

DAVOS: Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?

STANNIS: The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.

DAVOS: I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

STANNIS: Cleaner ways don't win wars.

DAVOS nods and walks away. STANNIS stares into the distance.


EXT. THE SHORELINE

DAVOS rows a boat into the shallows. MELISANDRE sits patiently.

MELISANDRE: Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

DAVOS: Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.

MELISANDRE:  You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

DAVOS: I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.

MELISANDRE:  If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.

DAVOS: And which are you?

MELISANDRE: Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.

DAVOS: Well, that must be very nice for you.

DAVOS stows the oars and enters the water to lead the boat to shore. He pulls it onto the shore.

MELISANDRE: Do you love your wife?

DAVOS: I do.

MELISANDRE:  Yet you have known other women.

DAVOS: Don't talk about my wife.

DAVOS secures the boat on the shore.

MELISANDRE:  I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe.

DAVOS does not respond.

MELISANDRE:  And you will.

MELISANDRE turns to grab something from the boat.

INT. A CAVE

DAVOS leads MELISANDRE through the cave, bearing a lantern.

DAVOS: Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.

MELISANDRE: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.

DAVOS holds up the lantern to bars that obstruct their way.

DAVOS: These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.

MELISANDRE: They can't bar our passage.

MELISANDRE has disrobed, arms outstretched, revealing a swollen, fully pregnant belly. DAVOS is shocked at this sudden change.

DAVOS: Gods protect us.

MELISANDRE: There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.

The lantern flares suddenly, surprising DAVOS, who retreats. MELISANDRE sits down behind him, and assumes a birthing position. She moans in pain as she gives birth. DAVOS watches in apprehension. MELISANDRE screams, and a foul spirit crawls from between her legs. It gathers strength and roars as it expands and takes to the air.
EXT. SHADOWLANDS

RENLY's encampment at night. The camp is alive with activity, in spite of the late hour. Soldiers move in every direction

INT. RENLY's tent. RENLY and CATELYN are seated across from one another while BRIENNE stands at guard.

RENLY: You swear it?

CATELYN: By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

RENLY takes a long sip of wine.

RENLY: Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your soncan go on calling himself King The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

CATELYN: And the wording of this oath?

RENLY: The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.

CATELYN considers these terms.

CATELYN: And in return for my son

RENLY: In the morning, I'll destroy my brother

RENLY stands.

RENLY:  When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.

RENLY walks across the tent. BRIENNE removes his cloak.

CATELYN: Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother

RENLY: Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.

BRIENNE continues to remove RENLY's armor.

RENLY: Please bring my terms to your son I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

The wind howls, and a dark cloud of mist races into the tent. CATELYN watches it cross the floor. BRIENNE gasps as a dark spirit takes form from the mist, rising up behind RENLY. The dark spirit stabs RENLY in the back, through the heart. RENLY gasps and the spirit hisses.

BRIENNE: No! No.

The dark spirit dissipates into a wind, and RENLY collapses to the ground. BRIENNE lungers forward to catch him, and bring him gently to the ground. Two soldiers leap into the room and draw their swords, believing BRIENNE to have betrayed their king.

SOLDIER #1: Follow me!

SOLDIER #2: (to BRIENNE) You'll die for this.

CATELYN: No, wait, it wasn't her!

The soliders rush past CATELYN to engage with BRIENNE, who meets them in battle. She quickly dispatches one of the soldiers. The second soldiers falls soon after, with BRIENNE plunging her sword down his spine. CATELYN stares while BRIENNE looks upon RENLY's corpse. She staggers and falls to her knees, sobbing over his lifeless body. CATELYN comes beside her to comfort her.

CATELYN: We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.

MAN #1: Inside the king's tent - go

MAN #2: Now.

BRIENNE: I won't leave him.

CATELYN: You can't avenge him if you're dead.

MAN: Over there, go!

BRIENNE gets up to leave. CATELYN tries to pull her to the front door. BRIENNE resists.

BRIENNE: Not that way.

BRIENNE exits past a tapestery. CATELYN follows.

CUT TO: THE SHADOWLANDS SHORE

STANNIS's boats sit off the coast. LITTLEFINGER takes them in, then walks towards the camp as soldiers rush by in disorder.

INT. RENLY's tent

Loras mournfully kneels beside RENLY's body. MARGAERY paces in the background.

MARGAERY: We need to go home. Loras.

LITTLEFINGER enters the tent, just short of a panic.

LITTLEFINGER: My lord, my lady.

LORAS: Get out.

LITTLEFINGER: Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king

LORAS: And you want that privilege for yourself.

LITTLEFINGER: You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.

MARGAERY: There's no time for this.

LORAS: Ride back to Highgarden, sister I'm not running from Stannis.

MARGAERY: Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

LORAS: I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king

LITTLEFINGER: Stannis.

LORAS: I will put a sword through his righteous face.

MARGAERY: You can't stay here.

LORAS: He would have been a true king

LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?

LORAS: Revenge.

LITTLEFINGER: I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

MARGAERY: You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.

MARGAERY moves to LORAS's side and caresses his hair. LORAS stands with a grimace. He picks up his sword and leaves. MARGAERY looks upon RENLY's corpse

MARGAERY: He was very handsome.

LITTLEFINGER: He was, Your Grace.

MARGAERY: "Your Grace." Calling yourself king

MARGAERY: And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

LITTLEFINGER: Do you want to be a queen?

MARGAERY: No. I want to be the queen.

MARGAERY turns and faces LITTLEFINGER, resolute.

EXT. KING'S LANDING

Three noble girls play blind man's bluff in a garden while a septa stands by. CERSEI watches from a window above

INT. TYRION's chambers

CERSEI: Killed? By whom?

TYRION: Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.

TYRION picks up a goblet

CERSEI: Really? Who'd have thought?

TYRION: Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.

TYRION pours himself some wine.

CERSEI: Whomever did it, I say well done.

TYRION: It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.

CERSEI finishes pouring her own wine.

CERSEI: Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.

TYRION: And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.

CERSEI: Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter

TYRION: She'll be safer in Dorne.

CERSEI: Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.

TYRION: It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.

CERSEI: So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?

CERSEI walks past TYRION and sits.

TYRION: Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.

CERSEI: No need to concern yourself over it. The king

TYRION: May I ask specifically what the king

CERSEI: You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.

TYRION: It's important that we talk about this.

CERSEI: It's the king

TYRION exits in frustration, while CERSEI takes a sip, enjoying the upper hand.

EXT. STREETS OF KING'S LANDING

BRONN stands waiting among the bustling cityfolk next to a small tent, where TYRION and LANCEL meet in secret.

LANCEL: It's wildfire.

TYRION: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin

LANCEL: No.

TYRION:That's a lie right there.

LANCEL: It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

TYRION: Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brotherand sister

LANCEL: I'm telling you the truth.

TYRION:The smart money would be on more likely.

LANCEL: She's making wildfire.

TYRION: But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.

LANCEL: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.

TYRION: I suppose there's only one way to find out.

LANCEL: They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.

TYRION: When did she tell you this?

LANCEL: I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.

TYRION: Swear to me on what?

LANCEL: On my life.

TYRION: But I don't care about your life.

LANCEL: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow

TYRION: All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.

TYRION pushes LANCEL out of the small tent. LANCEL falls to the ground, grunting.

TYRION: Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.

LANCEL: Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.

BRONN: It will be my pleasure.

LANCEL runs off down the streets. BRONN smiles.

CUT TO: STORMLANDS

STANNIS's forces have landed at RENLY's camp. DAVOS meets STANNIS as he enters the main courtyard, and they move through the compound at rapid pace.

DAVOS: Your Grace.

STANNIS: What is it?

DAVOS: I'm sorry about your brother I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.

STANNIS: Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy

DAVOS: I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.

STANNIS: I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.

DAVOS: Your Grace, I

STANNIS: I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.

They reach RENLY's tent.

DAVOS: And I've never known you to hide from the truth.

STANNIS: You've come to lecture me on truth?

DAVOS: I've come to tell you that what I saw

STANNIS: All my brother Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

DAVOS: Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron

STANNIS: I'll hear no more about it.

STANNIS stands over the war map.

MAN: Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.

DAVOS: When do we sail for King's Landing?

STANNIS: As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.

DAVOS: And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

STANNIS: That's not your concern.

DAVOS: If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

STANNIS: I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

DAVOS: Loyal service means telling hard truths.

STANNIS: Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?

DAVOS: She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.

STANNIS: What do you believe?

DAVOS: You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.

STANNIS: We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

DAVOS: Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.

STANNIS: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

DAVOS exits.

EXT. KINGS LANDING

A bustling market street. A girl grabs a fish from a bucket.

GIRL: I've got it! I've got it!

MAN: So it's that one there at the top, on the right.

MAN #2: Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

The lord is revealed to be TYRION, with BRONN walking behind him.

TYRION: Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?

BRONN: There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.

TYRION: Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.

BRONN: Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father

TYRION: He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

They come upon a crowd listening to a rabblerouser.

PROTESTER: Corruption.

CROWD: Yes!

PROTESTER: We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brotherfornicates with sisterin the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king

TYRION: It's hard to argue with his assessment.

BRONN: Not after what he did to your birthday present. The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

MAN: A dancing kingprancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey

TYRION: You have to admire his imagination.

BRONN: He's talking about you.

TYRION: What? Demon monkey?

BRONN: People think you're pulling the king They blame you for the city's ills.

TYRION: Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

BRONN: You don't need to convince me.

TYRION: Demon monkey.

CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS

THEON, walks up from a dock., in armor It is morning. He gazes on a ship and smiles. The crew walks up noisily.

MAN: Yeah, come on.

THEON: You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.

The crew ignores THEON.

THEON: Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!

BLACK LORREN: Where are we headed, Captain?

THEON: The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.

BLACK LORREN: And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

THEON: I do. Your captain.

BLACK LORREN stands directly in front of THEON, challenging him.

BLACK LORREN: I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?

BLACK LORREN walks away down the steps to the dock.

THEON: You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.

BLACK LORREN: (laughs)

YARA enters.

YARA: Stop. We yield.

The iron born laugh

YARA: Congratulations on your first command.

THEON: Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

YARA: Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow.

THEON: You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

YARA: That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore.

THEON's crew pushes off from the dock. They row away without him, laughing. DAGMER enters.

DAGMER: Come on, I'll take you out.

THEON: Who are you?

DAGMER: Dagmer, your first mate.

THEON: Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.

DAGMER: They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.

THEON: And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

DAGMER: You're not.

THEON: And yet that's the task my father

DAGMER: They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?

THEON follows DAGMER onto a dock, where he attends to a boat.

THEON: The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.

DAGMER: The seat of the House of Tallhart, - a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?

THEON:  No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then

THEON pauses and the idea of how to take advantage of the betrayal comes to full. He laughs, and DAGMER smiles back.

THEON: Take me to my ship.

CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS

INT. A CASTLE

While ARYA prepares food, TYRION presides over his war council.

REGINALD: The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.

TYWIN: The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.

AMORY: Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

TYWIN: And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?

REGINALD: We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

TYWIN: Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

REGINALD: My wife's in Lannisport.

TYWIN: Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.

REGINALD  rises, in scared disbelief.

TYWIN: If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!

REGINALD  exits. ARYA comes to TYWIN's side to pour him some wine. He stops her.

TYWIN: Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl Where are you from?

ARYA: Maidenpool, my lord.

TYWIN: And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.

ARYA: House Mooton, my lord.

TYWIN: And what is their sigil?

ARYA does not answer, she does not know.

TYWIN: A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl You're a Northerner, aren't you?

ARYA: (nods.)

TYWIN: Good. One more time, where are you from?

ARYA: Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

TYWIN: And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?

ARYA: They call him the Young Wolf.

TYWIN: And?

ARYA: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.

TYWIN: And do you believe them?

ARYA: No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.

They stare at one another, unblinking.

TYWIN: Fetch that water.

ARYA exits.

EXT. The exterior of the castle.

Arya walks to fetch water. She turns a corner and sees JAQEN coming towards her, dressed as a gold cloak. She lowers her head, trying to be unnoticed. They pass, and she continues. She enters the catacombs and passes a helmet. She realizes that JAQEN has forgotten it, and that he might return. Indeed, JAQEN turns the corner, walking slowly.

JAQEN: A girl

ARYA: (gasps)

JAQEN: A girl No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.

ARYA: I was always a girl.

JAQEN: And I was always aware. But the girl It is not for a man

ARYA: You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.

ARYA picks up the helmet and thrusts it into JAQEN's hands.

JAQEN: And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

ARYA:  I didn't have a choice.

JAQEN: You did. I did. And here we are.

ARYA fills her water pitcher, and steps back as JAQEN approaches her.

JAQEN: A man A man

ARYA: Three what?

JAQEN: The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.

ARYA: I can name anyone and you'll kill him?

JAQEN: A man

ARYA: The one who tortures everyone.

JAQEN: A man needs a name.

ARYA: I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.

JAQEN: That is enough. Go now, girl Your master

ARYA exits quickly.

CUT TO: The North

EXT. A winter landscape. Some men pull a large sled. The Night's Watch marches, single file.

JEOR: He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

JON: When will he come?

JEOR: The Halfhand does things in his own time.

JON: My uncle

JEOR: Most of them are true.

JON: I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

JEOR: The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.

JON: So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.

JEOR: Well, possible for the Halfhand.

SAM: Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.

EDDISON TOLLETT: (to GRENN) There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.

EXT. A snowy cliffside

One of the Night's Watch stands guard while the other set up camp .

MAN: About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.

SAM: The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.

EDDISON TOLLETT: Before I die, please, stop talking.

SAM: Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?

EDDISON TOLLETT: Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.

GRENN: (laughs)

JON: I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.

A horn sounds, and the men pause from their labor to see what is going on.

GRENN: Wildlings?

JON: One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.

EDDISON TOLLETT: So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes.

SAM: And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.

GRENN: But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?

SAM: Well I read it in a book.

EDDISON TOLLETT: I read it in a book.

EDDISON TOLLETT: and GRENN start to walk off

JON: Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.

EDDISON TOLLETT: Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah.

EDDISON TOLLETT leaves.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

TYRION is in a basement, holding a pot of wildfire.

HAYLENE: Take care, my lord.

TYRION: I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "

HAYLENE: Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.

TYRION hands the pot to HAYLENE, happy to give over the foul alchemy.

HAYLENE: After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.

BRONN: (scoffs)

TYRION: My companion

BRONN: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.

HAYLENE: Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.

BRONN: To do what?

HAYLENE: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.

TYRION: How much do you have?

HAYLENE starts to lead the others through a door and darker catacombs. TYRION and BRONN follow.

BRONN: If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father

HAYLENE: My lord, this man is insulting.

BRONN: I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.

TYRION: My friend

HAYLENE: He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

BRONN: Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.

HAYLENE forces open an ancient door. They enter a storeroom. TYRION is amazed at how much wildfire they have produced.

HAYLENE: We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.

BRONN: This is a shit idea.

TYRION: I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister You'll be making it for me.

CUT TO: QARTH

DAENERYS and DOREAH are on a balcony with Drogon, one of the dragons.

DAENERYS: Dracarys. Dracarys.

The dragon spits forth a small flame which cooks the raw meat before him. The women laugh and applaud.He easts

DAENERYS: He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

DOREAH reaches for Drogon.

DAENERYS: Let him sleep, Doreah.

DOREAH: Yes, Khaleesi.

Drogon climbs on DOREAH hand.

DAENERYS: (amused) He loves you.

IRRI: (Dothraki) I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.

DAENERYS: Thank you, my friend.

DOREAH: Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

IRRI: It is known.

DOREAH: And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos

DAENERYS: The last time a rich man

IRRI: (Dothraki) May he ride forever through the night lands.

DAENERYS: Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.

DOREAH: (chuckles) You would look like a real princess in Xaro's

IRRI: She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi.

All three are quiet in the awkward moment.

IRRI: You are their guest. It would be rude not to.

IRRI exits.

EXT. QARTH GARDEN PARTY

DAENERYS mingles during an elegant garden party.

WOMAN: And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.

DAENERYS: It sounds wonderful.

WOMAN: The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.

DAENERYS: Please excuse me for a moment.

DAENERYS joins JORAH, who is speaking with two Dothraki.

JORAH: (speakss Dothraki)

DAENERYS: What are they doing?

JORAH: Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.

KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Or melt it. Very simple.

DAENERYS: (Dothraki)  We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.

DAENERYS: (Dothraki) Not even when we leave.

KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Why not?

DAENERYS: (Dothraki) Our host

KOVARRO and MALAKKO exit. KOVARRO steals a goblet along the way.

DAENERYS: My brother

JORAH: It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.

DAENERYS: That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

PYATT PREE approaches them and bows.

PYATT PREE: Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?

PYATT PREE offers his hand and DAENERYS takes it. He places a gem in her palm.

PYATT PREE: Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.

PYATT PREE looks over his shoulder to his own doppelganger, who stands motionless. The crowd gasps.

PYATT PREE: Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

PYATT PREE and his twin both leave. The crowd applauds at the illusion. XARO comes to DAENERYS's side from the crowd.

XARO: My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

DAENERYS: What is the House of the Undying?

XARO: It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.

XARO leads DAENERYS away, leaving JORAH behind. QUAITHE, a masked woman, talks to JORAH.s

QUAITHE: You watch over her.

JORAH: Do I know you? I know you.

QUAITHE: Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. Who are you?

QUAITHE: I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power.

QUAITHE leaves.

CUT TO: WOODS IN THE SHADOWLANDS

BRIENNE and CATELYN stand next to a stream, having stopped to water their horses.

BRIENNE: It looked like Stannis.

CATELYN: To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.

BRIENNE: In the shape of Stannis.

CATELYN is unsure.

CATELYN:  We should reach my son

BRIENNE: Will you stay there long, my lady?

CATELYN: Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.

BRIENNE: I never knew my mother.

CATELYN: I'm sorry.

CATELYN walks to the fire and sits.  BRIENNE follows.

CATELYN: My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.

BRIENNE: It's a bloody business.

CATELYN:  What comes after is even harder.

BRIENNE: Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?

CATELYN: You mean to kill Stannis.

BRIENNE: I swore a vow.

CATELYN: But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

CATELYN: I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.

CATELYN: Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.

BRIENNE: I only held him that once as he was dying.

CATELYN stands and faces BRIENNE.

CATELYN: He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

BRIENNE: I do not know your son But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.

CATELYN: When the time comes, I will not hold you back.

BRIENNE draws her sword and kneels to pledge her loyalty.

BRIENNE: Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

CATELYN:  I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

INT. The main hall of Winterfell.

RICKON cracks nuts while BRAN receives visitors. LUWIN sits at his side.

WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night.

BRAN: We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.

WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours.

The WINTERFELL SHEPHERD leaves.

BRAN: (to RICKON) Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

LUWIN: Good.

BRAN: Hodor.

HODOR: Hodor.

RODRIK enters.

RODRIK: Bran! Lord Stark Torrhen's Square is under siege.

LUWIN: Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

RODRIK: Might be a raiding party led by the mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

BRAN: We have to help them.

RODRIK: Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men.

LUWIN: Do you need so many?

BRAN: If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

RODRIK: Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here.

RODRIK exits with his entourage.

EXT WINTERFELL

HODOR carries BRAN through the courtyard. OSHA walks beside him.

BRAN: So, what does it mean?

OSHA: Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.

BRAN: I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

OSHA: Must not mean anything, then.

BRAN: You're lying.

OSHA: You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.

BRAN: You know what it means.

OSHA: I never said I didn't.

BRAN: You didn't give me an honest answer.

OSHA: That's not the same as being a liar.

BRAN: Well, it's not far off.

OSHA: So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?

BRAN doesn't answer.

OSHA: Something bad? Tell me, boy

BRAN: I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them.

OSHA: The sea is hundreds of miles away.

BRAN: I know. It's just a stupid dream.

OSHA: I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

BRAN: Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?

OSHA: They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.

OSHA exits.

CUT TO: NORTH OF THE WALL

EXT. A winter storm howls as the Knight's Watchmen persevere.

QHORIN: There.

JEOR: Where?

QHORIN: On that mountain.

SAM: I don't see very well.

JON: A fire.

QHORIN: There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor.

JEOR: How many wildlings have joined him?

QHORIN: From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move.

JON:  Where?

QHORIN: Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.

JEOR: You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

QHORIN: Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that

JEOR: We need to get rid of those lookouts.

QHORIN: It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

JON: Lord Commander

QHORIN: I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

JON: I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?

QHORIN:  He's the one?

JEOR: Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.

QHORIN: Craster? In the boy

SAM: I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble.

JEOR: Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on.

EXT. QARTH GARDEN

The garden party has continued into the night.

XARO: So, tell me, how long has your manservant

DAENERYS: He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor

XARO: Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.

DAENERYS: And what about what a woman wants?

XARO: Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?

DAENERYS: To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.

XARO: Why?

DAENERYS: Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.

XARO: You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

DAENERYS: I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

XARO: Ah, a conqueror.

DAENERYS:  And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?

XARO: No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.

DAENERYS: So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious.

XARO: (chuckles)

DAENERYS: What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?

XARO: I will show you why.

He leads her away.

INT. A VAULT.

XARO strikes the door of the vault with a sword.

XARO: The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.

DAENERYS: And behind the door?

XARO: (chuckles)

DAENERYS: And it can all be mine?

XARO: All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies.  Enough to go home.

DAENERYS: All I have to do?

XARO: Is marry me.

DAENERYS: That was a romantic proposal.

XARO: I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses.

DAENERYS thinks about his proposition.

XARO: See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead.

INT. DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS

JORAH: If you cross the sea with an army you bought

DAENERYS: The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.

JORAH: To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.

DAENERYS: The usurper is dead.

JORAH: (laughs)

DAENERYS: The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.

JORAH: According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

DAENERYS: The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.

JORAH: Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.

DAENERYS: And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.

JORAH: I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, - but you must

DAENERYS: Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

JORAH: I only want

DAENERYS:  What do you want? Tell me.

JORAH: To see you on the Iron Throne.

DAENERYS:  Why?

JORAH: You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.

DAENERYS: So what would you have me do, as my advisor

JORAH: Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

DAENERYS: And how do I get the ship?

JORAH: I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.

DAENERYS: I look forward to meeting him.

JORAH: Khaleesi.

JORAH bows and exits.

EXT. RIVERLANDS

Tywin's emcampment with the recruits still held prisoner.

GENDRY fires a sword, and cools it in a bucket of water, while ARYA sits, bored.

ARYA: You should stand sideface.

GENDRY: Sideface?

ARYA: Sideways.

GENDRY: Why?

ARYA: Smaller target.

GENDRY: Am I fighting someone?

ARYA: You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.

A loud thud is heard, and a woman screams off camera. Arya rushes over to gold cloaks who surround a prone body.

GOLD CLOAK: Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

ARYA looks down upon the twisted body of the TICKLER. She looks up.

GOLD CLOAK: Go up the battlement.

WOMAN: That is strange.

ARYA spies JAQEN standing in the battlement above. He touches a finger beneath his eye. ARYA understands the gesture.

GOLD CLOAK: Move away. Stand back. He's dead.
EXT. WINTERFELL

LUWN pushes through a wooden exterior door, closes it and locks it behind him. Sounds of screaming and barking can be heard in the background. He turns and begins to write a message on a scroll. He attaches it to a raven and releases it just as the ironborn crash through the door. They take LUWIN prisoner.

INT. BRAN'S ROOM

THEON and DAGMER enter BRAN's room. THEON  walks up to the young lord, who lies in bed.

THEON: I've taken your castle.

BRAN: Theon?

THEON: It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.

BRAN: Why?

THEON: To take the castle.

BRAN: You went with Robb.

THEON: And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?

BRAN: I don't know.

THEON: Find the halfwit.

DAGMER: (nods)

THEON: My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.

BRAN: Why?

THEON: So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.

BRAN: I won't.

THEON: Yes, you will.

THEON moves closer to BRAN, who pulls himself up by a rope, hung from the ceilling.

BRAN: I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.

THEON sits next to BRAN on the bed.

THEON:  The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.

THEON gets up to leave.

BRAN: Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?

EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD

BRAN addresses a crow, sitting next to THEON. DAGMER, LUWIN, HODOR and RICKON stand watching.

BRAN: I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

THEON: Louder. Say Prince Theon.

BRAN: I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.

FARLEN: Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.

BRAN: Farlen, you be silent.

THEON: Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.

BRAN: All of you should do as he commands.

THEON: My father He claims the North as well by right of conquest. - You are all his subjects.

FARLEN: Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it

An iron born clubs FARLEN over the head. He screams and stumbles to the ground.

IRONBORN: Shut up!

THEON: If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester

LUWIN: I am.

THEON: I am the Lord Send the ravens.

LUWIN: My lord.

LUWIN exits, resigned. OSHA comes forward from the crowd.

OSHA: My Lord Greyjoy.

THEON: I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.

OSHA: You were here the day I was taken.

THEON: I'm the one who took you. What of it?

OSHA kneels.

OSHA: Let me serve you.

THEON: Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

OSHA: It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.

THEON: So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.

OSHA rises and brushes past THEON.

OSHA: Step aside.

BRAN: Why?

OSHA: It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me.

THEON: You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time--

BLACK LORREN: Greyjoy!

BLACK LORREN and another iron born bring a captive, bound and bloodied RODRIK CASSL into the courtyard.

BLACK LORREN: We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.

THEON: Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.

RODRIK: It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.

THEON: They are not my people.

RODRIK: King Robb thought of you as a brother.

THEON: My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.

RODRIK: Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

THEON: Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.

RODRIK: If he were alive to see this

THEON: He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.

RODRIK: I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.

THEON: You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll--

RODRIK spits in THEON's face. The iron born wrestle him to the ground.

THEON:  Take him to the cells. Lock him up

DAGMER: My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.

THEON:  I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.

DAGMER: No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives.

THEON considers and RODRIK fumes, on his knees. THEON looks at BRAN.

THEON: Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!

BRAN: No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.

THEON: The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

LUWIN: I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

THEON: He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.

LUWIN: He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do.

THEON considers, but DAGMER gives a quick shake of his head.

THEON:  You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.

DAGMER: Come.

BLACK LORREN and a second iron born pull RODRIK up. DAGMER draws his sword and steps across the courtyard. They follow, with RODRIK resisting.

BRAN: No! No! Theon!

RODRIK: (to THEON) Please

BRAN: Ser Rodrik!

The ironborn hold RODRIK in front of THEON and DAGMER. DAGMER is stands ready to execute RODRIK

RODRIK: He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

BRAN: I'm begging you.

RODRIK: Coward.

RODRIK is forced to his knees and THEON draws his sword in a wide arc.

BRAN: Stop. Stop! Stop right now!

THEON: You don't give commands anymore, little lord.

BRAN: Please, stop this. Please stop him.

RODRIK: Hush now, child I'm off to see your father

BRAN: You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

It starts to rain and Theon breathes heavily, his eyes wild. He holds his sword to the back of RODRIK's neck.

THEON: Any last words, old man?

RODRIK: Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost.

BRAN: Theon, please don't.

RICKON: Do something!

BRAN: I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!

THEON swings his sword down onto RODRIK's neck, but not hard enough to decapitate him. RODRIK spits up blood, suffering. Enraged, THEON swings three more times, then kicks RODRIK's severed head away. THEON pants while BRAN wails.

EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL

Ghost plods ahead of the Night's Watchmen.

JON: Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!

QHORIN: There goes your pet.

JON: He's not a pet.

QHORIN: No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing.

JON: Ghost is different.

QHORIN: So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.

JON: I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.

QHORIN: I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.

JON: We could do the same.

QHORIN: No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.

JON: My father

QHORIN: (laughs)

JON: I wasn't joking.

QHORIN: Look around, boy This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?

JON: (nods)

QHORIN: No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life.

JON:  I'll gladly give my life.

QHORIN: I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard Now, do you understand me?

JON: I do.

QHORIN: You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.

Ghost walks behind the men. JON moves to catch up.

INT. SHADOWLANDS CASTLE

TYWIN meets with his war council. ARYA comes in to serve wine.

TYWIN: Can you read?

AMORY: My lord?

TYWIN: Can you read?

AMORY stares blankly.

TYWIN: This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

AMORY: My apologies, my lord. I must have

TYWIN: Girl It's the one on this

ARYA picks up the correct volume right away and brings it to the table. TYWIN chuckes and stands.

TYWIN: My cupbearer can read better than you.

TYWIN opens the book

TYWIN: To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?

AMORY: My lord, I

TYWIN: To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.

AMORY stands, and leaves.

TYWIN: Put the book away, girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.

There is a knock on the door and a kings guard enters.

GUARD: Lord Petyr Baelish.

TYWIN: Mmm. Give us the room.

The war councils leaves.

TYWIN: (to Arya) Clear all this.

LITTLEFINGER enters.

LITTLEFINGER: Lord Tywin.

TYWIN: (not amused) Baelish.

ARYA continues to clear the table.

TYWIN:  Wine?

LITTLEFINGER: Thank you.

They sit at the table. ARYA takes a deep breath, for she does not want LITTLEFINGER to recognize her, while she must also attend to TYWIN without raising his suspicions.

TYWIN: What news from the capital? I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.

LITTLEFINGER: So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.

ARYA serves wine to LITTLEFINGER, who raises his glass to his lips. ARYA tries to walk away from the table, but TYWIN stops her, and hands her more to clear.

TYWIN: Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.

LITTLEFINGER: It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.

TYWIN: You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?

LITTLEFINGER: After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, - feeding horses and soldiers.

TYWIN:  Yes, yes, yes.

LITTLEFINGER: The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery

TYWIN: Wants to be queen

LITTLEFINGER: Yes, she does.

TYWIN: House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson

LITTLEFINGER: They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

TYWIN: (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.

ARYA continues to move so that LITTLEFINGER cannot see her face clearly.

LITTLEFINGER: If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN: The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?

LITTLEFINGER: They have.

ARYA spills some wine, and tries to mop it up in a panic.

ARYA: Pardon, my lord.

LITTLEFINGER:  It's only wine.

LITTLEFINGER tries to look at ARYA's face, but TYWIN pulls his attention away.

TYWIN: You would ride there yourself?

LITTLEFINGER: Tonight, with your leave.

TYWIN:  I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl

ARYA steps away from the table, but continues to listen as she walks away.

TYWIN: And what else?

LITTLEFINGER: On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.

TYWIN: Why?

LITTLEFINGER: He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.

TYWIN: Hmm.

EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL.

JON, QHORIN and the party of Night's Watchmen creep among rocks and snow of a mountaintop, stalking a wildling camp by a fire. The wildlings, tending to their duties. QHORIN signals and one of the Night's Watchmen lets loose an arrow, striking a wildling in the chest. A short skirmish ensues. JON grapples a hooded wildling into submission, after preventing her from grabbing a weapon. Her hood falls away to reveal YGRITTE, panting. JON is shocked.

JON: A girl.

QHORIN: A wildling.

JON: We could question her.

QHORIN: You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.

JON: What's your name?

YGRITTE: Ygritte.

QHORIN picks up the axe that YGRITTE was reaching for.

QHORIN: She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.

QHORIN throws the axe down to emphasize his point.

YGRITTE: I gave you my name.

JON: I'm Jon Snow.

JON stands back but keeps his blade trained on YGRITTE's face. She looks at the fallen wildlings.

YGRITTE: You ought to burn them you killed.

QHORIN:  We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?

YGRITTE: Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.

QHORIN: Our boy He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?

YGRITTE: The free folk.

QHORIN:  How many?

YGRITTE:  Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow.

QHORIN: Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king

YGRITTE doesn't answer. She locks eyes with JON.

QHORIN: Do you mean to march on the Wall?

QHORIN leans down closely and places his hand on YGRITTE's face.

QHORIN: Do you know who I am, girl

YGRITTE: Qhorin Halfhand.

QHORIN:  Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?

YGRITTE: They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow.

QHORIN nods and stands back.

QHORIN: We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?

QHORIN draws his sword.

JON: No. No, I'll do it.

QHORIN: Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now.

QHORIN and the watchmen exit. JON points his sword at YGRITTE's face, who still lays still on the rocks. He hesitates.

YGRITTE: You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.

JON pushed the point of his sword into her chin to quiet her.

JON: I'm as much a crow as they are.

YGRITTE rolls onto her stomach, accepting her fate. JON positions his sword above the back of her neck.

YGRITTE: Will you burn me? After?

JON: Can't. Someone might see the smoke.

YGRITTE pulls her hood back in frustration. She wants a clean death. JON rests the sword on the back of her neck.

YGRITTE:  Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold.

JON continues to hesistate. Go on. Be quick about it.

JON pulls the sword away. YGRITTE looks at him in frustration.

YGRITTE:  Do it. Bastard, do it!

JON brings his sword over his head, and strikes downward, hitting the rock in front of YGRITTE's head. She looks at the blade before her face, and realizes that JON cannot bring himself to kill her. They look at one another and she seizes her chance. She slams a rock into JON's knee, and he falls. She runs, putting her hood back on. JON pursues her as she runs down the mountainside. Both are desperate. JON can't seem to catch up, but he spies an opportunity to shortcut the fleeing YGRITTE. He takes another route, and slides down a hill to tackle YGRITTE. He drops his sword in the process, but pulls out a knife, and places at her throat.

YGRITTE:  You can't do it. We both know it.

JON turns her over, and stands above her.

YGRITTE: The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close.

JON: I'll find them.

YGRITTE:  Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.

EXT. KING'S LANDING

A shoreline at King's Landing. In a skiff crowded with people, MYRCELLA sit down, looking back at the shore. The HIGH SEPTON (OR JUST A SEPTON?) blesses her travels.

HIGH SEPTON: May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.

CERSEI and TYRION watch the boat disembark.

CERSEI: One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.

TYRION turns to face her. CERSEI continues to look straight ahead. He walks away, silently.

CUT TO: the crowd

JOFFREY, SANSA, TOMMEN and MERYN watching in the crowd. TOMMEN is crying.

JOFFREY: You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.

SANSA: I saw you cry.

JOFFREY: Did you say something, my lady?

SANSA: My little brother

JOFFREY: So?

SANSA: It seems a normal thing.

JOFFREY: Is your little brother

SANSA: No.

JOFFREY: Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog

JOFFREY leaves, followed by the HOUND. They walk past CERSEI on their way out. She still stares after the skiff.

EXT. THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING

JOFFREY walks through the crowd, among his kingsguard. TYRION and TOMMEN are with him. The crowd begins to hassle JOFFREY.

MAN: Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

MAN #2: Murderer! Bastard!

MAN #3: All hail the King.

MAN #4: He's no king.

MAN #5: He's a bastard!

MAN #6:Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.

MAN #7: Freak.

TYRION turns to one of the guards.

TYRION: Get the Prince

GUARD: Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

Some of the guards escort TOMMEN away, hopefully to safety.

WOMAN: Please, Your Grace, give us some food!

MAN: Bread, Your Grace, please!

JOFFREY ignores them, until he is hit in the face with a mudball. He groans and doubles over. The HOUND and the other kingsguard draw their swords to defend the king

JOFFREY: Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!

The HOUND holds JOFFREY back, trying to control him.

GUARD: Hold on!

GUARD #2: Hold them back!

The kingsguard push into the crowd. A full riot begins. SANSA and her hand maidens are scared.

JOFFREY: Just kill them! Kill them all!

CERSEI looks back at TYRION

TYRION:  Move. Move!

The HOUND grabs JOFFREY around the chest and guides him forward.

GUARD: Pull back!

MAN: Tear him to pieces!

JOFFREY: What are you doing? I want these people executed!

HOUND: And they want the same for you.

The riot escalates. SANSA flees awkwardly. TYRION watches in horror as the crowd tears one of their party limb from limb. The crowd cheers.

TYRION: Where's Sansa?

GUARD: Through the door.

GUARD #2: Come on.

GUARD #3: Push hard.

The crowd closes around them. MERYN strikes down one of the crowd.

MERYN: Protect the king!

GUARD: Get back!

GUARD #2: Fall back! Keep him safe!

The Hound passes JOFFREY off to  MERYN and sets on the crowd. Meanwhile, the kingsguard shepherd Joffrey through a gate.

GUARD: Come in! Come in!

CUARD #2: Keep him safe!

CROWD: Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!

GUARD: Watch out. Hold them back.

GUARD #2: Come on.

SANSA is trapped by the crowd. She runs down a dark passage, and some men from the crowd follow

MAN: Hey.

CUT TO: away from the crowd

JOFFREY and his guards are safely away from the crowd.

JOFFREY: Traitors! - I'll have all their heads.

TYRION: You blind, bloody fool.

JOFFREY: You can't insult me.

TYRION: We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

JOFFREY: You can't

TYRION: I can, I am.

JOFFREY: They attacked me!

TYRION: They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool. All because of a war you started.

JOFFREY: You're talking to a king!

TYRION slaps him.

TYRION: And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl

JOFFREY: Let them have her.

TYRION: If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING INTERIOR

SANSA runs in desperation from the men who pursue her. One catches up grabs her arm. She slaps him, and he hits her in return. She spins to the ground. Two other men catch up. They tear at her cloths.

MAN: Where are you going?

MAN #2:You ever been fucked, little girl?  Come here.

CUT TO: the royal party

TYRION: Take some men and go and find the Stark girl

MERYN: I take my orders from the king.

MAN: Where? This way.

CUT TO: Sansa and her assailants

The three men drag SANSA across the floor. She fights back but there are too many of them.

SANSA: Please! No! No!

The men continue their assault. One holds down her hands while the others tear at her clothes. The HOUND appears and guts one of them, holding him by the neck before dropping him to the floor. He takes care of the rest. SANSA lies on the ground, terrified and whimpering.

MAN: Please!

The HOUND reaches down to help SANSA up.

HOUND: You're all right now, little bird. You're all right.

She accepts his help, and he carries her away, over his shoulder.

CUT TO: The riot

The melee continues. It has spiraled further out of control.

CUT TO: the royal party

The HOUND carries SANSA past TYRION and into safety with the rest of the royal party. He sets her down gently, with her back to the wall

MAN: We'll get you.

MAN #2:  We'll get you.

MAN #3: This way.

TYRION: Are you hurt, my lady?

HOUND: The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.

TYRION:  Well done, Clegane

HOUND: I didn't do it for you.

EXT. A COURTYARD IN MEREEN

DAENERYS paces while XARO watches. KOVARRO sits nearby.

DAENERYS: He shouldn't make me wait.

XARO: The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

DAENERYS: I already have a husband.

XARO: Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.

DAENERYS: And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.

XARO: I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.

SPICE KING:The Mother of Dragons!

XARO: Ah, here he comes.

The SPICE KING enters, descending a staircase with his entourage.

SPICE KING: Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.

The SPICE KING descends the staircase.

XARO: Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.

SPICE KING: Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square.

DAENERYS: Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.

SPICE KING: Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?

DAENERYS: My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

SPICE KING: I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.

DAENERYS: I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.

SPICE KING: I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.

DAENERYS: Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.

SPICE KING: Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

DAENERYS: My father

SPICE KING: But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take the Iron Throne"?

DAENERYS: I didn't come here to argue grammar.

SPICE KING: Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?

DAENERYS: Not yet.

SPICE KING: You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

DAENERYS: There are many there that support my claim.

SPICE KING: When were you there last?

DAENERYS: I left when I was a baby.

SPICE KING: So, in truth, you have no allies.

DAENERYS: The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.

SPICE KING: Ah. Forgive me, little princess Now if you'll pardon me.

DAENERYS: Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.

SPICE KING: A shrewd man.

DAENERYS: For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.

DAENERYS ascends the stairs to meet the SPICE KING.

DAENERYS: Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.

SPICE KING: I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess

DAENERYS: I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.

The SPICE KING ascends the staircase to leave. His entourage follows.

SPICE KING: Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

INT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE SHADOWLANDS. It is dusk.

ARYA comes to clean the table. She notices the scroll, which mentions ROBB, and begins to read it. TYWIN enters, catching her in the act.

TYWIN: Who taught you to read?

ARYA: My father

TYWIN: Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?

ARYA: A stonemason.

TYWIN: A stonemason who could read? Hmm.

ARYA: He taught himself.

TYWIN: Quite a man. What killed him?

ARYA: Loyalty.

TYWIN: You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

ARYA: Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.

TYWIN: No. But you've already begun.

ARYA: Did you know your father, my lord?

TYWIN: I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.

TYWIN sits. While his back is turned, ARYA steals the scroll that she was reading.

TYWIN: He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.

ARYA: I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

TYWIN: Mmm.

ARYA exits.

EXT. COURTYARD IN THE RIVERLANDS.

ARYA hides in a corner, above the bustle of the courtyard. She pulls out the scroll to read what it says about ROBB. She gets up with purpose.

INT. THE RIVERLANDS.

ARYA runs down the steps. Not looking where she is going, she runs into AMORY LORCH

AMORY: Where are you going, girl?

ARYA: The armory, my lord.

AMORY: Why?

ARYA: Lord Tywin sent me.

AMORY: What might this be?

ARYA: Lord Tywin gave it to me.

AMORY: What for?

ARYA: To take to the armory.

AMORY: Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.

ARYA flees and AMORY pursues her.

AMORY: Move! Get out of the way!

ARYA  scampers through the courtyard and he follows clumsily. AMORY loses sight of her, and she stays hidden just out of sight, beyond a doorway. AMORY goes the wrong way, and she takes advantage of his mistake and runs the other way. She encounters a kingsguard who she mistakes for JAQEN. She grabs him for attention. He turns to her, and she realizes her mistake. She continues on and finds JAQEN just a bit further on.

ARYA: Amory Lorch.

JAQEN: A girl A man will do what must be done.

ARYA: Now!

JAQEN: A girlcannot tell a man A man

ARYA: But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.

JAQEN: (sighs)

INT. THE COUNCIL ROOM

AMORY enters the council room, where TYWIN sits working. TYWIN rises while AMORY collapses to the floor, dead.

TYWIN: Guard!

EXT. THE STARK WARCAMP.

ROBB walks among his men and greet them as he passes them.

SOLDIER: Your Grace.

SOLDIER #2: Your Grace.

SOLDIER #3: My honor, Your Grace.

SOLDIER #4: Your Grace.

QUENT: Your Grace.

ROBB: Quent.

ROBB sees TALISA sitting by a tent. He approaches her.

ROBB: Lady Talisa.

TALISA: Your Grace.

ROBB: I'm not sure I'm a lady.

TALISA: Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.

ROBB: It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.

TALISA: Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

ROBB: Because it's obvious.

TALISA: What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?

ROBB: I'd call you a liar.

TALISA:  Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.

ROBB: (nods)

TALISA: I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

ROBB: Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

They look around, awkwardly.

ROBB: Quite a pretty spot.

TALISA: Will we be here long?

ROBB: I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.

TALISA: I'm not a spy.

ROBB: Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

TALISA: You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. "The young wolf is on the move. " Perhaps you'd join me. If you've got time, of course, for, well

CATELYN enters

CATELYN: Robb.

ROBB turns to CATELYN and embraces her. TALISA looks down.

ROBB: Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very helpful.

CATELYN:  Lady Talisa.

TALISA: Lady Stark.

CATELYN: Lady Talisa

TALISA: Maegyr.

CATELYN:  Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.

TALISA: An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.

TALISA exits. ROBB and CATELYN begin to walk.

ROBB: I've missed you.

CATELYN: Yes, you look positively forlorn.

ROBB: You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.

CATELYN: I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

ROBB: I know.

CATELYN: You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.

ROBB:  I know.

CATELYN: A debt that must be paid.

ROBB: I haven't forgotten.

ROOSE BOLTON enters

ROOSE: Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.

ROOSE holds up a scroll.

EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL

JON and YGRITTE walk through the mountains. Her hands are bound, and he leads her by a rope.

YGRITTE: Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.

JON: We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.

YGRITTE: Here? There's no shelter here.

JON: There's no shelter anywhere.

YGRITTE: There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire

JON: No fire.

YGRITTE: But a fire is

JON: No fire.

YGRITTE: Have it your way.

JON forces YGRITTE to lie down. He begins to walk away.

YGRITTE: We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

JON pauses.

YGRITTE: Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.

YGRITTE turns to sleep. JON looks back at her, then joins her, reluctantly.

YGRITTE: Think they're out looking for you?

JON: Yes.

YGRITTE: Think they'll find you?

JON: Yes.

YGRITTE: You're brave. Stupid, but brave.

They are both exhausted.

JON: We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

YGRITTE wiggles next to JON.

JON: Stop moving.

YGRITTE: I'm just trying to get comfortable.

JON: Stop it!

She begins moving again.

JON: You're still moving.

YGRITTE: Was I? I didn't notice that time.

JON: (sighs)

YGRITTE smiles

INT. ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER

ROBB, CATELYN and ROOSE are in the midst of a discussion.

ROBB: This cannot be true.

ROOSE: We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true.

ROBB: Why? Why would Theon

ROOSE: Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

ROBB: My brothers?

ROOSE:  We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

CATELYN: I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

ROBB: I must go north at once.

ROOSE: There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

ROBB: How can I call myself king

ROOSE: You are a king And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.

CATELYN: Let me go and talk to Theon.

ROBB: There will be no talk. He will die for this.

ROOSE: Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy

ROBB: Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.

INT. WINTERFELL

THEON, OSHA  talk by a fire. An iron born keeps her bound.

THEON: Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?

OSHA: I'm no liar.

THEON: All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

OSHA: I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord.

THEON: How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.

OSHA: There are other ways to serve, my lord.

THEON: I'm a prince

OSHA: There are other ways to serve, my prince

THEON: Like what?

OSHA: We know things, the free people.

THEON: You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?

OSHA: Other things.

OSHA begins to undress

OSHA: Savage things.

THEON: Wait outside.

THEON takes a bite of his apple, The iron born leaves and ASH lets her dress fall to the floor.

THEON: I always wondered what you had under there.

OSHA: It comes at a price.

THEON: I'm not killing you. That's your price.

OSHA: I already had that.

THEON: What do you want then, other than your miserable life?

OSHA: What all free people want. My freedom.

THEON: Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.

INT. KING'S LANDING

SANSA is seated. SHAE attends to her wounds.

SANSA: Ow!

SHAE: Shh. It's not deep.

SANSA:  I thought they were going to kill me.

SHAE: They thought so, too.

SANSA: He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.

SHAE:  Of course he did.

SANSA: Why? Why would a stranger

SHAE: You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

SANSA: I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king

SHAE: Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you

SANSA: But you're not the wrong people.

SHAE: Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.

INT. WINTERFELL at night.

THEON sleeps. OSHA slinks away. She walks through the courtyard and encounters

GUARD: And where are you going?

OSHA: I have something for you from Prince Theon.

GUARD: What?

OSHA: Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.

OSHA kisses him and he responds. She pulls a knife and slits her throat.

EXT. WINTERFELL at night.

OSHA crouches by a tree and whistles. From the doorway comes RICKON, HODOR and BRAN, followed by their direwolves. The sneak away into the darkness of the woods.

EXT. QARTH GARDEN PATH

DAENERYS and XARO. KOVARRO trails them.

DAENERYS: The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

XARO: When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets.

XARO opens the door for DAENERYS. They move into the courtyard to find it strewn with bodies,  throats cut. DAENERYS takes in the scene, and then runs in a panic.

XARO: Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi.

Bells toll as DAENERYS runs, followed by KOVARRO and XARO. She climbs a staircase to her chamber, where IRRI lies slain. The dragons are gone.

DAENERYS: Where are they? Where are my dragons?

EXT. QARTH

A hooded figure walks up an exterior staircase toward a tower, the House of the Undying, burdened by a covered basket. The dragons screech from inside.
INT: WINTERFELL

THEON wakes and notices that OSHA has gone.

EXT: WINTERFELL

THEON dresses down BLACK LORREN while DAGMER watches.

THEON: A cripple

BLACK LORREN: The giant must have took him.

THEON: The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple And Rickon, too? The little one?

BLACK LORREN: Gone, along with the wildling woman The one you were fucking.

THEON punches BLACK LORREN in the jaw, who falls to the ground. THEON shakes the pain out of his fist. HE then kicks BLACK LORREN repeatedly.

THEON: Right. Get the horses and the hounds.

DAGMER: (laughs)

EXT: WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

Leashed dogs chase the scent of the fugitives. Mounted riders follow.

MAN: Come on, find the scent. Where they going?

The dogs seem to have picked up a scent and they pause.

DAGMER: Halt!

The riders stop.

THEON: Enjoying your first hunt?

LUWIN: So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.

THEON: With hunting, there's blood at the end.

LUWIN: They're little boys.

THEON: I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

LUWIN: Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.

THEON: They have no value to me missing.

LUWIN: Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.

THEON: Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.

MAN:  We have a scent!

THEON: The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.

THEON rides on. LUWIN follows.

EXT: WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

The direwolves walk along a stream. HODOR, BRAN, RICKON and OSHA follow.

OSHA: We should have took more food.

BRAN: We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

OSHA: Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.

BRAN: And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

OSHA: The boy can't survive on walnuts.

RICKON:  I'm fine.

RICKON cracks the walnut he holds

OSHA: We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire. Hodor:  Hodor.

OSHA: Even you, sweet giant.

HODOR: Hodor.

The party crests a small rise. The sounds of children shouting playfully can be heard in the distance.

BRAN:Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

RICKON: Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.

BRAN: We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.

RICKON: Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

OSHA: You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

BRAN: They'll be after us with hounds.

OSHA: We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.

EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL

JON and YGRITTE sleep, entwined. YGRITTE feels JON's manhood against her.

YGRITTE: Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

JON rolls away quickly, embarrassed. He stands.

YGRITTE: What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.

JON: Let's move.

He pulls her up and checks her binding.

YGRITTE: It is the first time. How old are you, boy?

JON: I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

YGRITTE: You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets

JON: Don't call them that.

YGRITTE: What, stones? Or bone?

JON: Neither. Both.

Having checked her bindings, he picks up his sword and leads her off.

JON: Move!

YGRITTE: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?

JON: There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

YGRITTE: So the lads just do it with each other?

JON: No.

YGRITTE: Never?

JON: Never. We swore an oath.

YGRITTE: You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.

JON pulls at her bound hands.

JON: Would you please shut up?

YGRITTE: Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. - I'm a free woman.

JON: You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.

JON: If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

YGRITTE: And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.

JON: It was my choice to say the words.

YGRITTE: So you don't like girls?

JON: Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them.

JON: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

YGRITTE: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands

JON: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother

YGRITTE: Yhey're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.

JON: My father I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

YGRITTE: So why are you fighting us?

YGRITTE turns and walks down the slope. JON follows.

EXT: SHADOWLANDS COURTYARD

In a misty morning, a man twitches while hung by a noose. Another screams in pain.

MAN: Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up.

Above the courtyard, TYWIN listens, and sniffs a wooden toothpick

TYWIN: Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.

MOUNTAIN: We hanged 20 men last night.

TYWIN: I don't care if you hanged 100. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.

ARYA sets the table and listens.

MOUNTAIN: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

TYWIN: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.

MOUNTAIN: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane

TYWIN: Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.

The MOUNTAIN exits.

TYWIN: Mmm. Is that mutton?

ARYA: Yes, my lord.

TYWIN: Don't like mutton.

ARYA: I'll bring something else.

TYWIN: Leave it. Are you hungry?

ARYA: No.

TYWIN: Of course you are. Eat.

ARYA: I'll eat in the kitchen later.

TYWIN: It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.

ARYA sits and eats the mutton.

TYWIN:  You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.

ARYA: I eat a lot. I just don't grow.

TYWIN looks out the window.

TYWIN:  Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.

ARYA: Have you ever lost before?

TYWIN: Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?

ARYA: (shakes her head)

TYWIN: But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.

ARYA realizes that TYWIN has let his guard down, and considers her options. But he turns back to her and she starts, suddenly.

TYWIN: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.

TYWIN walks to the fireplace.  The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had 35 hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?

ARYA: Dragons?

TYWIN: Yes. Dragons happened.

TYWIN pours himself some wine.

TYWIN: Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name

ARYA: Aegon and his sisters.

TYWIN: Mmm?

ARYA: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

TYWIN: Correct. A student of history, are you?

ARYA: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.

TYWIN: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

ARYA: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.

TYWIN: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

ARYA: (smiles)

TYWIN:  Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

ARYA: Most girls are idiots.

TYWIN: You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

ARYA: From my father

TYWIN: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

ARYA: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

TYWIN: Careful now, girl I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.

ARYA rises, clearing the dishes and walking away.

TYWIN: And, girl

ARYA stops.

TYWIN: "M'lord.

ARYA turns, confused.

TYWIN: " Lowborn girls say "m'lord," not "my lord. " If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.

ARYA: My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.

TYWIN: You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?

TYWIN: Go on.

ARYA exits and TYWIN ponders, and drinks his wine.

INT: KING'S LANDING

SANSA walks through a castle hallway. The HOUND comes in the other direction.

SANSA: I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.

HOUND:  Brave? A dog

SANSA: Does it give you joy to scare people?

HOUND: No, it gives me joy to kill people.

SANSA: (gasps)

HOUND: Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.

SANSA: It was his duty. He never liked it.

HOUND: Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

SANSA: Why are you always so hateful?

HOUND: You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queenand I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king

SANSA turns and walks away.

EXT: QARTH GARDEN

DAENERYS and XARO walk through the garden, anxiously.

XARO: I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.

DAENERYS: You are one of the Thirteen.

XARO: If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own.

DAENERYS: Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.

XARO: Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.

DAENERYS: There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?

XARO: I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.

DAENERYS: But it did happen under your roof.

XARO: Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been

DAENERYS: I don't care where you've been.

DAENERYS steps quickly up the stairs. MALAKKO blocks XARO's way.

EXT: THE FAR NORTH

JON and YGRITTE continue their trek among the mountaintops. JON keeps looking back at her.

YGRITTE: You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.

JON: No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.

YGRITTE: We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.

YGRITTE comes closer.

YGRITTE: You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.

JON: Walk.

YGRITTE: I could teach you how to do it.

JON: I know how to do it.

YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.

YGRITTE walks ahead. JON follows.

EXT: THE RIVERLANDS

The Stark war camp is quiet. SER ALTON reports to ROBB stark while RIKARD KARSTARK, ROOSE and ??? look on.

ROBB: And what did she say?

ALTON: She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

ROBB: And what then?

ALTON: She

ROBB: If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

ALTON: She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

ROBB: You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

ROOSE: Too many prisoners.

ROBB: Is there room for Ser Alton?

RICKARD KARSTARK: Does he need to lie down?

ROBB: Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Torrhen.

TORRHEN grabs ALTON's should to lead him away

ROBB: That will be all.

ALTON, TORRHEN, RICKARD KARSTARK and ??? leave. TALISA enters.

TALISA: Your Grace. A minute of your time?

ROOSE leaves, eying TALISA.

TALISA: I've been treating your wounded men.

ROBB: And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.

TALISA: They're not my enemies.

ROBB: That's what I tell my bannermen.

TALISA: I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses. But some are not. I need silk for stitching. I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.

ROBB:  If you need help finding these

TALISA: I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

ROBB: Continue, my lady.

TALISA: You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?

ROBB: Yes.

TALISA: The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.

ROBB: I expect he will.

TALISA:If I could write a list.

ROBB: Come with me to the Crag.

TALISA: I don't think that will be

ROBB: Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.

ROBB exits.

EXT: FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

THEON's search party has come upon the farmhouse. They mill around, trying to pick up the scent.

WOMAN: Children, come inside, quick. Come on.

CHILD: Hurry up!

MAN: Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent.

THEON: Try again.

MAN: We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.

The MAN continues to lead his dog through the farm.

LUWIN: We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.

THEON grabs LUWIN.

THEON: I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.

Two ironborn lead the WINTERFELL SHEPHERD to THEON.

MAN #2: Prince Theon.

THEON: Where are they?

WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: Who, m'lord?

THEON: The Stark boys. Where are they?

WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: I don't know. I seen no one.

THEON punches him in the gut.

THEON: Think harder.

WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

THEON makes to punch him again, but DAGMER has found something by the hay bales.

DAGMER: My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for.

THEON comes over and DAGMER shows him a handful of walnut shells. THEON looks around

DAGMER: Send the old man home.

THEON: (nods)

THEON walks up to LUWIN.

THEON: Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.

LUWIN: Theon, don't do this.

The ironborn take LUWIN away.

INT: DAENERYS'S ROOM IN QARTH

DAENERYS stands sadly. JORAH enters.

DAENERYS: You came back.

JORAH: As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?

DAENERYS: Irri is dead.

JORAH: I know. She was a good

DAENERYS: She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

JORAH: Doreah?

DAENERYS: We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.

JORAH: I should have been here.

DAENERYS: You went to find me a ship.

JORAH: My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.

DAENERYS: "These people"?

JORAH: They are not to be trusted.

DAENERYS: And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

JORAH: Your people are in Westeros.

DAENERYS: The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

JORAH: They will soon enough.

DAENERYS: And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother

DAENERYS: You are not your brother

JORAH: Trust me, Khaleesi.

DAENERYS: There it is. "Trust me. " And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

JORAH: You are too young to be so

JORAH reaches for her.

DAENERYS: And you are too familiar.

JORAH: Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.

DAENERYS: Find my dragons.

JORAH exits.

EXT: THE FAR NORTH

JON and YGRITTE are still walking in the desolate snowlands.

YGRITTE: How long till we get back to your crows?

JON: We're close.

YGRITTE: What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?

JON: We're close.

YGRITTE: What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?

JON: Nothing happened between you and me.

YGRITTE: "I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, "we were only close together for warmth. "And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. "I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. "And before I knew what was where, his his "Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. "And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! "And he spread me legs and ruined. "The shame of it. "Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. "What will me poor savage father say?"

JON: Turn back around.

YGRITTE: "And I thought that we were done, but he said, "'Turn back around." I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just

JON: What, right here in the muck?

YGRITTE: I'll keep you warm enough.

JON pulls on her restraints, releasing her hands.

YGRITTE: Are you that afraid of it?

JON: That's enough.

YGRITTE: It's nice and wet and warm.

JON: Enough!

YGRITTE: It don't have teeth.

YGRITTE comes closer. JON is tempted, but comes to his senses and grab the hilt of his sword. YGRITTE backs off.

YGRITTE:  All right! All right. Gods, you're dull.

YGRITTE quickly snares the rope around her leg and pulls JON down to the ground. He grunts and she takes off running. Jon gets up and chases her. She disappears down a slope. Jon runs to where he last saw her, and finds her bindings, cut. He hears a whistle, and looks up to see YGRITTE and two other wildlings on a ledge above him. She is smiling. Jon looks around to see that he is surrounded by wildlings.

YGRITTE: Should have took me while you had the chance.

INT: KING'S LANDING

SANSA is having a nightmare, reliving the attempted rape by the rioters.

SANSA: No, no!

She wakes in a start, and pulls back the covers to see that her first period has begun. She is distraught

SANSA: No. Oh, no.

SANSA gets up, grabs a knife and tries to remove the bloodstain. SHAE enters the chamber with SANSA's breakfast. She rushes over to help

SHAE: It's all right. Give me that.

SANSA: If the Queen

SHAE: Help me flip it over.

While SHAE and SANSA try to flip the mattress, another handmaiden enters. They stop. The handmaiden turns and rushes out of the room. After exchanging a glance with SANSA, SHAE follows her.

INT: DARK HALLWAY

The handmaiden moves quickly. SHAE pursuers her.

SHAE: Where are you going?

HANDMAIDEN:  To tell Her Grace.

SHAE pulls a knife and holds it to the handmaiden's throat.

SHAE: You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?

The HANDMAIDEN nods in fear and then runs off. SHAE watches her go, then returns.

INT: SANSA'S ROOM

SHAE rushes back to SANSA's room. The HOUND is already there. SANSA sits on her bed, dejected.

INT: CERSEI'S ROOM

CERSEI and SANSA enter.

CERSEI: Your mother You flowered, my dear. No more.

SANSA: My mother

CERSEI: In what way?

SANSA: I thought it would be less Less messy.

CERSEI: Wait until you birth a child.

SANSA sits on the edge of the bed.

CERSEI: You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?

SANSA: I'm fit to bear children for the king

CERSEI: A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.

SANSA: (nods)

CERSEI: Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

SANSA: His Grace was not with you?

CERSEI: Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

SANSA looks down.

CERSEI: You may never love the king

SANSA: I love His Grace with all my heart.

CERSEI: That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.

SANSA: But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

CERSEI: You can try, little dove

SANSA looks down, sadly.

EXT: RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT

A guard checks on the prisoners in the Stark encampment. JAIME and ALTON share a cell.

CERSEI: Who did you say your mother was again?

ALTON: Cinda Lannister.

JAIME: Is she the fat one?

ALTON: Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she

JAIME: No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.

ALTON: I squired for you once, you know.

JAIME: When?

ALTON: The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

JAIME: I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

ALTON: You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.

JAIME: He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?

ALTON: Bryan.

JAIME: Poor lad. That was my brother I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.

ALTON: That's right. I ran up and volunteered. "Let me, my lord. Let me. " My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.

JAIME: You didn't, though.

ALTON: You really remember?

JAIME: You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.

ALTON: When I think back to that day

GUARD:  Shh!

JAIME: You were saying?

ALTON: I Never mind. It's embarrassing.

JAIME: More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?

ALTON: I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.

JAIME: I understand completely.

ALTON: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.

JAIME: It's just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.

ALTON: Which knight was it?

JAIME: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.

ALTON: What was he like?

JAIME: He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.

ALTON: It's hard to put into words.

JAIME: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.

ALTON: (nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.

ALTON: Did you squire for him again?

JAIME: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.

ALTON: (smiles)

JAIME: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.

ALTON: And have you thought about

JAIME: Of course. Every day.

ALTON: And?

JAIME: Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.

ALTON: (nods)

JAIME: But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.

ALTON: What is it?

JAIME looks out at the guards.

JAIME: It's actually quite simple.

ALTON: Well, let me help you.

JAIME: You'll only have to do one thing.

ALTON: Tell me.

JAIME: (whispers)You'll have to die.

JAIME headbutts ALTON and then beats him to death with his chained hands. TORRHEN comes to check on his bloodied body. JAIME chokes him with his chained hands until his neck snaps. JAIME takes the keys to complete his escape.

EXT: QARTH GARDEN

JORAH enters a garden where QUAITHE covers the back of a man with symbols painted in blood.

QUAITHE: Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.

JORAH: I didn't come here for lessons.

QUAITHE: No, you came for the dragons.

JORAH: You have them? Where are they?

QUAITHE: Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

JORAH does not answer. She returns to painting.

QUAITHE: You love her.

JORAH: Where are the dragons?

QUAITHE: Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

JORAH does not answer.

QUAITHE: Will you betray her again?

JORAH: Never.

QUAITHE: The thief you seek is with her now.

QUAITHE returns to painting and JORAH exits, quickly.

INT: QARTH COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN

DAENERYS appears before the Thirteen to plead for her dragon's return.

SPICE KING: I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.

XARO: No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?

DAENERYS: Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

SILK KING: Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.

DAENERYS: Without me, the dragons will die.

SPICE KING: It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.

PYATT PREE: You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi.

DAENERYS:  How?

PYATT PREE: I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.

DAENERYS: You have my dragons?

PYATT PREE: When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King He procured them for me.

DAENERYS:  But there is no King

XARO: There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.

XARO stands.

XARO: You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.

PYATT PREE joins XARO's side.

SPICE KING: Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatando not make you a king

XARO: An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.

PYATT PREE: The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.

PYATT PREE's doppelgangers slit the throats of the other members of the Thirteen, simultaneously. DAENERYS is horrified, and flees. She encounters another PYATT PREE clone. KOVARRO comes to her side to defend her, but JORAH stabs PYATT PREE from behind first.

PYATT PREE: A mother should be with her children.

JORAH removes his sword and PYATT PREE collapses into a pile of empty clothes, an illusion. Another clone appears.

PYATT PREE:  Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.

DAENERYS, JORAH and KOVARRO exit.

CATELYN sits in her tent, writing. JACKS tries to enter.

JACKS: Lady Stark!

BRIENNE blocks JACKS at the door.

BRIENNE: No farther.

JACKS: Keep your hands off me, woman.

BRIENNE: Don't enter without an invitation, man.

JACKS: Forgive me. Lady Stark.

CATELYN: What is it?

JACKS: They caught the Kingslayer.

CUT TO: THE CAMP

JAIME is being led in chains by a mounted soldier, back into camp. The other soldiers assault him verbally. They jostle at one another in an attempt to make the assault physical, but his captors keep the other men away.

MAN: Kingslayer!

MAN #2: Kill the fucking Kingslayer!

MAN #3: Hang him!

MAN #4: Hang him!

MAN #5: You'll die today.

MAN #6: Justice for the Karstark.

They proceed further into the camp, but the angry soldiers eventually overpower JAIME's protectors. One man clubs him over the head and JAIME falls. The crowd gathers around to further abuse him. JAIME lies in pain. The horseman rides away, leaving JAIME in the hands of his captors, with a thick crowd behind him. They bring JAIME to his feet. He walks a few paces and then falls to his knees under the pressure of the crowd.

MAN: Gut him!

RICKARD KARSTARK swiftly approaches the crowd and draws his sword.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.

CATELYN, BRIENNE and JACKS enter.

CATELYN: Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.

RICKARD KARSTARK: This monsterkilled my son

CATELYN: And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.

RICKARD KARSTARK: I will have his head. And if you try and stop me

CATELYN: You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king

RICKARD KARSTARK: And where is our king

ROBB: You know very well.

RICKARD KARSTARK: He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him.

CATELYN: How dare you!

BRIENNE starts to draw her sword.

BRIENNE: Threatening my lady is an act of treason.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

CATELYN: I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my sonthe King

RICKARD KARSTARK: When your son

CATELYN: Wise men do not make demands of kings.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.

RICKARD KARSTARK exits

JAIME: Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but

CATELYN: Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!

JAIME: You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.

CATELYN: And gag him!

CERSEI and TYRION are in her bedroom. CERSEI is lighting candles with a long straw.

TYRION: Since when do you light your own candles?

CERSEI: Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.

She blows out the flame on the straw's end.

CERSEI: How many times can you read one raven scroll?

TYRION: Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

CERSEI:  More than we have.

TYRION: Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.

CERSEI: We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.

TYRION: "Rain fire on them from above." You're quoting Father

CERSEI: Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

CERSEI: I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

TYRION: He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead

CERSEI: I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.

TYRION: I thought the girls might help him.

CERSEI: Did you?

TYRION: I was wrong. If we can't control him

CERSEI: Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.

TYRION: It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.

CERSEI: I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.

TYRION: The boy

CERSEI: Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.

TYRION: Sins?

CERSEI: The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? "Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."

TYRION: You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.

CERSEI begins to cry. TYRION approaches, perhaps to comfort her, but there is no closeness between them.

EXT: ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT

The soldiers mill about. Two of them are engaged in an argument.

MAN: Then why wait?

MAN #2: We're sworn to the king.

MAN: There's not a king.

MAN #2: That's treason.

MAN: So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

MAN #2: Back off, you.

MAN: No, I won't.

BRIENNE and CATELYN watch from a distance, concerned about the lack of order.

BRIENNE: Your son

CATELYN: So they say.

BRIENNE: The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

CATELYN: Come.

BRIENNE follows CATELYN. A guard leads them into JAIME's cage. He is covered in blood.

CATELYN: I need to be alone with him.

GUARD:  My lady, our orders

CATELYN: Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.

The guard exists. BRIENNE moves outside the cage.

JAIME: Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?

CATELYN: Do you hear them out there? They want your head.

JAIME: Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

CATELYN: You strangled his son

JAIME: Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.

CATELYN: You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

JAIME: So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your fatherdespises the king No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?

CATELYN: She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.

JAIME: Kingslayer. What a king Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.

CATELYN: You are a man without honor.

JAIME: Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard

CATELYN: Brienne.

JAIME: No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy

CATELYN: (to BRIENNE) Your sword.

BRIENNE unsheathes her sword and hands it to CATELYN.

EXT: WINTERFELL

THEON address the crowd.

THEON: I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.

DAGMER and an iron born raider lead LUWIN through the crowd.

LUWIN: What are you doing? What have you done?

THEON: If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.

THEON gestures behind him. The raiders raise two bodies of children, hanged by their necks and burned beyond recognition. The crowd is horrified.

LUWIN: No!

THEON looks upon the bodies, and then looks down, feeling a pang of guilt
EXT. WINTERFELL

A soldier empties a basket of dead ravens out a tower window. They collect at the feet of THEON and DAGMER.

MAN: Riders approaching!

MAR #2: Open the gate!

The gates open slowly and a band of riders canter into the courtyard. Among them is YARA, who exchanges glances with THEON before she circles him.

INT. DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL

Yara and her men have made themselves at home, feasting and sitting leisurely at the table. THEON enters.

YARA: Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

The men laugh.

THEON: Envy isn't attractive.

YARA:  What envy?

THEON: You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.

YARA: You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the crippleor the six-year-old

THEON: I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery.

YARA: You treated them with honor? By butchering them?

THEON: Before I had to kill them, - I treated them -

YARA: You seized their home, as is your right. We're ironborn, we take what we need.

THEON: Exactly.

YARA: Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.

THEON: They made me a promise

YARA: Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

THEON: Don't call me

YARA: A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?

THEON: If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.

YARA: You are weak. And you're stupid.

THEON: I'm warning you.

YARA: Go on, then. Warn me.

THEON pauses.

THEON: You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?

YARA: You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father

THEON: Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.

YARA: Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out

THEON: He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.

YARA: (to her men) Leave us.

Her ironborn men get up from the table and exit. YARA gets up and faces THEON.

YARA: Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother We both endured our father Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

THEON: I don't intend to die.

YARA: You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea.

YARA exits.

EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL

A party of wildlings, including JON and YGRITTE cross a frozen lake, joining a large band nearer the shore. RATTLESHIRT walks forward to meet them.

YGRITTE: I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

RATTLESHIRT: I already got one crow. Don't need two.

YGRITTE: Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.

RATTLESHIRT:The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.

YGRITTE: He could have killed me half a dozen times.

RATTLESHIRT: And now he wishes he did. Gut him.

A wildling draws a knife at the command.

YGRITTE: He's a bastardof Winterfell, Ned Stark's son

RATTLESHIRT turns around.  Mance will want him.

RATTLESHIRT: What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard

YGRITTE: I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.

RATTLESHIRT walks to face YGRITTE

RATTLESHIRT: He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

YGRITTE: He runs, I'll do it meself.

RATTLESHIRT walks away.

YGRITTE: We're even now, Jon Snow.

YGRITTE exits. The wildlings force JON down on his knees, next to QHORIN, who also been captured.

JON: I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't

QHORIN: I know.

JON: The others?

QHORIN: When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you.

JON: They died because of me.

QHORIN: See that it wasn't for nothing.

Two wildlings approach, and lift QHORIN to his feet.

WILDLING: All right, up, lad.

WILDLING #2: Come on, on your feet, now. Move it.

EXT. WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS

ROBB and TALISA walk through the trees as the sun sets, followed by soldiers and horses.

TALISA: Is she beautiful?

ROBB:  I've never met her.

TALISA: What's her name?

ROBB: Frey I don't know her first name.

TALISA: I'm sure you'll be very happy.

They laugh together.

TALISA: And you're marrying her for a bridge?

ROBB: An important bridge.

TALISA:  Ah.

ROBB: It was before they killed my father I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.

TALISA: When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father

ROBB: He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but

TALISA: Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.

ROBB: He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, "How can a man be brave if he's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.

TALISA: I wish I could have met him.

ROBB: He would have liked you.

TALISA: (chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

ROBB: He didn't care much about gold or glory.

TALISA:  And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.

TALISA: Then why don't you?

ROBB: Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.

TALISA: Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.

ROBB: That would be a start.

Riders approach.

MAN: Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

ROBB: How? How?

INT. CATELYN'S TENT

ROBB enters, finding CATELYN at her desk.

ROBB: Tell me this isn't true.

CATELYN doesn't answer. She looks up at him.

ROBB: Why?

CATELYN: For the girls.

-ROBB: You betrayed me.

CATELYN: Robb

ROBB: No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.

CATELYN: Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free.

RICKARD KARSTARK: I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.

CATELYN:  I grieve for your sons, my lord.

RICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.

CATELYN : Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.

ROBB: Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.

CATELYN: Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

SOLDIER: Forty, Your Grace.

ROBB: Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

CATELYN: Robb.

ROBB exits.

EXT. RIVERLANDS WOODS.

A white horse gallops over a small hill, riderless. Nearby, BRIENNE pushes JAIME off his mount, hooded and chained. She sends the horse off. She helps him up

JAIME: Damn.

She unhoods him. and helps him tstand.

JAIME: You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.

BRIENNE leads the chained JAIME forward.

JAIME: A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.

BRIENNE: Brienne of Tarth.

JAIME: Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.

JAIME: Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.

BIRENNE forces him down to his knees on the riverbank. A canoe sits nearby.

JAIME: I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me.

BRIENNE looks off down the river, concerned of being seen.

BRIENNE: Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

JAIME: Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?

BRIENNE: You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.

JAIME: Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?

BRIENNE pulls JAIME up and leads him to the river's edge.

BRIENNE: You will not provoke me to anger.

JAIME: I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?

BRIENNE:  I've never seen you fight.

JAIME: The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.

BRIENNE: All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.

JAIME: If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.

BRIENNE: Do you take me for an idiot? In!

JAIME enters the canoe and lies down. BRIENNE boards as well and sits in the stern.

JAIME: I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.

BRIENNE: Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

BRIENNE launches the canoe and paddles it downstream.

INT. CASTLE RUINS IN THE SHADOWLANDS

TYWIN sits in council with KEVAN LANNISTER and other Lannister bannermen. ARYA attends to them, and listens intently

KEVAN: King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.

TYWIN: Surrender the Iron Throne?

KEVAN: Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.

TYWIN: No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.

KEVAN: The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.

TYWIN: Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner.

ARYA serves win to the table

TYWIN: Too close to Casterly Rock.

KEVAN: He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

TYWIN: He's a boy He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

TYWIN ponders for a while by the hearth. He makes his decision.

TYWIN: We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.

ARYA looks worried.

EXT. CASTLE RUINS IN THE SHADOWLANDS

ARYA walks through the dismal courtyard. Soldiers torture their prisoners.

GUARD: You've got some questions to answer.

MAN: Who killed Ser Amory?

MAN #2: I don't know! Please!

MAN: Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.

MAN #2: I told you, I don't know. Please.

ARYA comes across RORGE, and BITER, sitting with some Lannister soldiers.

RORGE: Look, it's Yoren's little cunt Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

ARYA: Where's Jaqen?

RORGE: Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch

GUARD: Come on, time to kill some wolves.

They stand. Both RORGE and BITER eye ARYA as they walk past.

CUT TO: THE FORGE

HOT PIE sits talking while GENDRY works some horse shoes, listless.

HOT PIE: You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

ARYA enters.

ARYA: Where's Jaqen?

HOT PIE: How would I know?

ARYA: I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

GENDRY: You need him?

ARYA:  He's helping me.

HOT PIE: I saw him.

ARYA: Where?

HOT PIE shrugs and pops his pastry in his mouth. ARYA comes over and grabs his ears.

ARYA: Where?

HOT PIE: Ow!

ARYA: Where?

HOT PIE: They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.

ARYA tightens her grip.

HOT PIE: On patrol. Let go of my ears.

She does. ARYA turns at sound of horses, and watches TYWIN mount. She walks towards him

HOT PIE: What do you want with him anyway?

ARYA watches TYWIN and his men ride off.

EXT. THE NORTH

QHORIN: Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

JON: They'll never trust me.

QHORIN: They might. If you do what needs to be done.

JON: What?

QHORIN: (yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl

JON: I didn't.

QHORIN:  I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard

QHORIN pushes Jon roughly, sending him tumbling down the side of the hill. RATTLESHIRT confronts QHORIN

RATTLESHIRT: He's not yours to kill, crow

RATTLESHIRT pushes QHORIN forward. YGRITTE pauses and looks sympathetically down the slope at JON, reconsidering him. JON sits up and looks back at her.

INT. KING'S LANDING

BRONN and TYRION sit in his chambers. TYRION is attempting to read, but he is annoyed by BRONN's fingernail scraping with a compass.  TYRION; Do you have to do that here?

BRONN: I like to keep me hands clean.

TYRION: Yes, but do you have to do it here?

BRONN looks at TYRION, then throws the compass down on the desk in front of him.

TYRION: You should start wearing the gold cloak.

BRONN: I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

TYRION: You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common

BRONN: A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

TYRION: Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.

BRONN: We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

TYRION: Fine, fine. No gold cloak.

TYRION goes back to his work. BRONN sucks his teeth and drums his finger, continuing to look at TYRION.

TYRION: What?

BRONN:  What?

TYRION: What? What? Why are you staring at me?

BRONN: (scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?

TYRION: To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.

BRONN laughs as he stands up, and begins to pace around.

TYRION: Stannis will be here any day.

BRONN picks up a book from the pile as he walks past.

BRONN: And one of these explains how to beat him?

TYRION gestures to the volume that he is reading.

TYRION: "An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. " By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.

BRONN: Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.

VARYS enters.

VARYS: My Lord HandCommander I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?

He sits.

TYRION: I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?

BRONN: Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.

TYRION: For questioning?

BRONN: No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.

TYRION: We talked about this.

BRONN: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.

BRONN sits back down at the table.

BRONN: The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.

VARYS: Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.

BRONN: (nods)

VARYS: Ah. "The Great Sieges of Westeros." Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.

TYRION grabs a parchment and unrolls it.

TYRION: Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.

VARYS: And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?

BRONN: We could throw books at his men.

VARYS: We don't have that many books.

BRONN: We don't have that many men, either.

VARYS: What do we have?

TYRION: Pig shit.

EXT. THE FAR NORTH

The Night's Watch camps on the top of a cliff. The wind howls. GRENN, EDDISON TOLLETT and SAM dig in the snow.

SAM: (panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

SAM sits down to rest. The others continue to dig.

EDDISON TOLLETT: I always imagined meself doing something much worse.

GRENN: We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.

EDDISON TOLLETT: You lack imagination.

SAM: Where do you think Jon is right now?

EDDISON TOLLETT: He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.

SAM: He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.

GRENN: Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.

SAM: He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

EDDISON TOLLETT: So did his father.

SAM: And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

EDDISON TOLLETT: Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.

GRENN's shovel clangs against something metal.

GRENN: What in seven hells is that?

He plants his shovel and starts digging and clearing with his hands. SAM comes over to see. GRENN reveals a round stone cover, engraved with markings.

SAM: The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.

GRENN lifts the cover and finds a bundle wrapped in a cloak.

GRENN: Look.

EDDISON TOLLETT: If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.

SAM: That's a Night's Watch cloak.

GRENN: It's been here a long time.

GRENN opens the bundle to reveal a set of obsidian knifes.

SAM: Oh. Must be dragonglass.

GRENN: Dragonglass?

SAM: The maesters call it obsidian.

GRENN: Why would a brother hide it here?

EDDISON TOLLETT: I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.

EXT. SHADOWLANDS COURTYARD

ARYA caries a yoke with two buckets of water. She bumps into a Lannister soldier, and the contraption falls, spilling her load.

SOLDIER: Mind where you're going.

The SOLDIER smacks her across the head. ARYA looks dejected and crouches to pick up the empty bucket.  A SOLDIER stops next to her.

ARYA: I'm sorry. I'll

ARYA stands, and realized that it is JAQEN.

ARYA: (annoyed) Where were you?

JAQEN: A man

ARYA: Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.

JAQEN: A girl The Red God demands it. Give the man

ARYA: How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?

JAQEN: A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not.

JAQEN puts down his helmet and sits.

ARYA: He's taking his army to attack my brother I need him dead right now.

JAQEN: This a man cannot do.

He pours some water from a pitcher, and drinks.

ARYA: You promised you'd help me.

JAQEN: Help was not promised, lovely girl Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name.

ARYA: And you'll kill them? Anybody?

JAQEN: By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.

ARYA: All right. Jaqen H'ghar.

JAQEN considers.

JAQEN: A girlgives a man

ARYA:  That's right.

JAQEN:  Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.

ARYA:  I'm not joking. A man

JAQEN:  Un-name me.

ARYA: No.

JAQEN:  Please?

ARYA: I'll un-name you.

JAQEN:  Thank you.

ARYA:  If you help me and my friends escape.

JAQEN: This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.

ARYA: Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

JAQEN: A girl If I do this thing, a girl

ARYA: A girl

JAQEN: A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.

JAQEN exits.

INT. KING'S LANDING

CERSEI'S CHAMBERS

PODRICK pours wine for TYRION, who is seated at a table. CERSEI stands in the background.

TYRION: Thank you, Podrick.

CERSEI: Odd little boy.

TYRION: I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

CERSEI: You and Varys both.

TYRION removes his napkin from his neck and wipes his face.

TYRION: Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.

CERSEI: He's only a boy.

TYRION: Younger boys are off fighting his war.

CERSEI: He's not ready.

TYRION: What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17?

CERSEI: Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield.

TYRION: It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.

PODRICK snickers.

CERSEI: Do you think I'm an idiot?

TYRION: No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.

CERSEI: You shipped off my only daughter And now you want to send my eldest son

TYRION: He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?

CERSEI: Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

TYRION: Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.

CERSEI: Because he doesn't have a cock.

TYRION: Neither do you.

CERSEI: Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.

TYRION: It's not that little.

CERSEI: (laughs)

TYRION: Why are you smiling?

CERSEI: Because I'm happy.

TYRION: And why are you happy?

She sits.

CERSEI: Because I have your little whore

TYRION: I thought you preferred blondes.

CERSEI: Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father

TYRION: Why do you care who I fuck?

CERSEI: Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter

TYRION: This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.

CERSEI: For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.

TYRION: Where did you find her?

CERSEI: Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.

TYRION: You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.

CERSEI: Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

TYRION: You don't buy them, you only rent them.

CERSEI: You're usually a better liar, baby brother This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt

TYRION: And how do I know you haven't killed her already?

CERSEI: Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother

MANDON moves behind her and opens the chamber door. TYRION looks worried. Two guard bring in the wrong whore. TYRION looks her over.

TYRION: I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.

TYRION takes her hand.

TYRION: I promise I will free you.

WHORE: Don't forget me.

TYRION: Never.

The guards take her away. CERSEI looks pleased.

TYRION: I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

CERSEI: Get out.

INT. KING'S LANDING

TYRION walks through the hallway and bursts into his chambers.

TYRION: Shae!

SHAE: I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?

TYRION: You're beautiful.

SHAE smiles and kisses him.

SHAE: Then why do you look sad?

TYRION kneels before her.

TYRION: We have to be more careful.

SHAE: Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

TYRION: There are people who want to hurt me.

SHAE: I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.

TYRION: I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.

SHAE: I'm yours.

TYRION: Promise me.

SHAE: I'm yours, and you are mine.

They kiss.

INT. THE RIVERLANDS

ROBB and ROOSE sit in conference.

ROBB: Still no word?

ROOSE: We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard Once he captures the castle

ROBB: Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle

ROOSE: He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.

ROBB: Send word to your son. Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

ROOSE: A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much

ROBB: Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.

ROOSE: I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.

TALISA enters. They stand

TALISA: Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

ROOSE: My lady.

ROOSE exits.

TALISA: How are you?

ROBB: How am I? I've had to arrest my mother The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.

TALISA: I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

ROBB: No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.

TALISA: You have every right. You're a king

ROBB: That's not the kind of king I want to be.

TALISA: What kind do you want to be?

ROBB: I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord

TALISA: I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.

ROBB: I'd like to hear you play the harp.

TALISA: No. No, you would not.

They laugh. Robb pours some wine and hands it to her.

ROBB: How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?

TALISA: When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.

They both stand.

ROBB: I don't want to marry the Frey girl

TALISA: I don't want you to marry her.

ROBB: But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

They kiss passionately, and undress one another in a fury. They make love on the floor.

EXT. THE SHADOWLANDS

The courtyard at night.

HOT PIE: The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.

GENDRY: Shut up.

HOT PIE: Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven.

ARYA: Shut up. What did you bring?

HOT PIE: The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages. GENDRY What did he want us to do about those guards?

ARYA: He didn't say. He just said, "Walk through the gates."

GENDRY: What about the guards?

ARYA: He didn't say anything about the guards.

GENDRY: What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

ARYA: We have to trust him.

GENDRY: Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.

HOT PIE: I want to go back to the kitchens.

ARYA: Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

ARYA gets up and walks towards the gate.

GENDRY: Arry, don't.

GENDRY and HOT PIE follow. When they reach the guards, they realize that all have been slaughtered. They walk through the gate.

EXT. STANNIS'S FLEET

Soldiers fire a large crossbow in the night.

MAN: Away! Reset!

DAVOS and STANNIS stand on deck.

DAVOS: If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

STANNIS: Will it hold?

DAVOS: Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

They walk down some steps to the main deck and continue on.

MAN: Again, pull!

STANNIS: I admire you, Ser Davos.

DAVOS: I thank you, Your Grace.

STANNIS: Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

DAVOS: My son Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me.

STANNIS: Do you? Why?

DAVOS: My father

STANNIS: And?

DAVOS:  Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink.

STANNIS: And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?

DAVOS: Many fought bravely for your brother Many fought for the Mad King.

STANNIS: You defend these men who insult you behind your back. Some are happy to do it to my face. We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

DAVOS: No one has forgotten, Your Grace.

STANNIS:  No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.

DAVOS: He was only a boy

STANNIS:  Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

DAVOS: (exhales)

STANNIS: First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.

DAVOS: And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

STANNIS:  Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.

DAVOS: I was relieved they did not.

STANNIS: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brotherand he was the king But now, I'm the rightful king And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand

DAVOS: Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.

STANNIS: I expect you'll be the first crabberson

EXT. KING'S LANDING

JOFFREY, VARYS and TYRION walk through the streets of King's Landing

JOFFREY: You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.

VARYS: No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

JOFFREY: The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.

TYRION: To strike? My dear nephew

JOFFREY: If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him.

TYRION: A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

JOFFREY: They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.

JOFFREY exits.

TYRION: Imagine Stannis' terror.

VARYS: I am trying.

TYRION: You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

VARYS: Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.

TYRION: I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.

VARYS: I wish we could, too.

TYRION: What do you want? Tell me.

VARYS: If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

TYRION: My brother My sisterbecame queen When I reached manhood, my father

VARYS: A most highborn plumber.

TYRION: The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my fathernamed me acting Hand

VARYS: You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. - You enjoy the game.

TYRION:  I do. Last thing I expected.

VARYS: And you play it well.

TYRION: I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.

VARYS: They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.

TYRION:  The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?

VARYS: In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

TYRION: We should sail there immediately.

VARYS: This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.

TYRION: A girl

VARYS: She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide.

TYRION: One game at a time, my friend.

EXT. QARTH

DAENERYS peers through a boarded entryway

JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

DAENERYS: Astapor? We cannot stay here. They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.

JORAH: They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

DAENERYS: You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.

JORAH: You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

DAENERYS: Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.

JORAH: That's what the warlock He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong.

DAENERYS:  And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?

JORAH: Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face.

DAENERYS touches JORAH's face.

DAENERYS: They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.

JORAH: (nods)

EXT. WINTERFELL

THEON: We should bury them.

DAGMER: I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.

THEON: If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

DAGMER: What's this?

THEON: Gold for the farmer For his trouble.

DAGMER: His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.

LUWIN approaches and exchanges a glance with OSHA. She ducks into an entryway. LUWIN looks at THEON and DAGMER.

DAGMER: His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.

LUWIN walks over to look at the burned bodies of BRAN and RICKON.

CUT TO: DARKNESS

OSHA lights a candle.

OSHA: Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.

LUWIN: You're right so far.

OSHA: Who was that out there hung up at the gates?

LUWIN: Must have been the farmer

OSHA: He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?

LUWIN: They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.

OSHA: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.

BRAN sits just out of sight, having heard everything. HODOR and RICKON sleep.
EXT. THE SEA AT NIGHT

STANNIS's fleet sails through the night.

DAVOS walks the deck, and looks out the stern at the rest of the ships.

CUT TO: STANNIS looks ahead

CUT TO: Soldiers sitting below, tired and waiting. One vomits from sea sickness.

CUT TO: MATTHOS and DAVOS above deck.

MATTHOS: That's it. The tide's against us.

DAVOS: Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.

MATTHOS: You're coming home.

DAVOS: King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.

MATTHOS: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.

DAVOS: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.

MATTHOS: Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.

DAVOS: Gods be good.

MATTHOS: God. Father

DAVOS: But not over them?

MATTHOS: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

DAVOS: Well, first, we have to put it there.

MATTHOS: Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.

DAVOS: Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.

MATTHOS: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.

INT. KING'S LANDING AT NIGHT

TYRION and SHAE lie in bed in his chambers.

SHAE: Are you afraid, my lion

TYRION: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.

SHAE: I won't let them hurt you.

TYRION: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.

SHAE sits astride him.

SHAE: It is now.

TYRION: You can't fuck your way out of everything.

SHAE: I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.

They kiss.

INT. CERSEI'S CHAMBERS

CERSEI looks out her window.

PYCELLE: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.

CERSEI: Your words are always wise and measured.

PYCELLE: If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King

CERSEI: You brought me something?

PYCELLE: Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however

CERSEI: I know what ten drops will bring.

PYCELLE: Your Grace, if I may ask

CERSEI: You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

PYCELLE: Yes. A siege is very

CERSEI: Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester There are so many.

PYCELLE: Your Grace.

INT.  KING'S LANDING

BRONN and the soldiers of King's Landing are drinking and singing, with some prostitutes mingling among them. BRONN has his arm around a prostitute.

MEN: (singing) And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls And not a soul to hear -

BRONN: To the boys!

MEN:

SOLDIER: Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

BRONN: Drunk Lannisters.

The soldiers laugh.

PROSTITUTE: You've got a pretty voice.

BRONN: Thank you very much.

PROSTITUTE: And I like your nose. How many times you break it?

BRONN pulls her to stand in front of him.

BRONN: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.

PROSTITUTE:  Oh.

BRONN: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.

BRONN start to undress her.

BRONN: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time

The prostitute is fully naked, and BRONN's thoughts are going elsewhere.

BRONN: Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.

She sits on his lap and kisses his nose.

PROSTITUTE:  Poor nose.

BRONN: Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.

The men laugh.

The HOUND and a soldier enter.

BRONN: Welcome, friends. This round's on me.

The HOUND and his companion stand in front of a table. The two men sitting there vacate if for them, silently. They sit down. The HOUND drinks from the mug sitting there.

BRONN: (whispering) I don't think he likes me.

HOUND: You think you're a hard man? I know it.

The men laugh.

BRONN: It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.

HOUND: Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.

He stands and walks towards BRONN.

HOUND: Only smaller.

BRONN: And quicker. Eh?

HOUND: Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.

BRONN pats the prostitute on the knee, and she gets off his lap. He stands to face the HOUND.

BRONN: Aye I expect he will someday.

He reaches behind him to a dagger sheathed at his waist. A bell tolls. The soldiers get up and leave.

MAN: Here we are.

BRONN: One more drink before the war? Shall we?

The HOUND backs off. They both exit.

INT.  TYRION'S CHAMBERs

VARYS stands by the window while PODRICK helps to dress TYRION in his armor.

VARYS: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.

TYRION: A wedding.

VARYS: Exactly. Podrick, is that it?

TYRION: "Is that it?" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

VARYS: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

TYRION: I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

VARYS: Do you trust him?

TYRION: Oddly enough, I do.

VARYS: Good.

VARYS unfolds a map before them.

VARYS: The map you asked for.

TYRION steps down to study the map. PODRICK continues to dress him.

TYRION: There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.

VARYS: Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.

TYRION:  I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

VARYS: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.

TYRION:  Well, I'm not.

VARYS: For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess

TYRION: What of it?

VARYS: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?

TYRION: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?

VARYS: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.

TYRION: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.

VARYS: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.

TYRION: No, I don't believe you have.

VARYS: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.

PODRICK hands TYRION his war axe.

EXT.  STANNIS'S FLEET

MATTHOS: They're welcoming the new king.

DAVOS: I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.

MATTHOS: Drums!

Soldiers start to play the drums. The soldiers spring to action, readying for battle. STANNIS watches, resolute.

INT. King's Landing

TYRION: Remember, wait till the ships

BRONN: The ships are in the bay.

TYRION: They must be far enough in

BRONN: I know what "in" means. Do you know how to use that?

TYRION: I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother

BRONN: I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.

They clasp hands.

BRONN: Don't get killed.

TYRION:  Nor you, my friend.

BRONN: Oh, are we friends now?

TYRION: Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.

BRONN: Enhances it, really.

TYRION: Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

BRONN: Been spending time with fancy folks.

BRONN exits. SANSA and SHAE enter.

TYRION: Lady Sansa and Sheila.

SHAE: Shae.

TYRION: Shae, yes. Surely my sister

SANSA: She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

JOFFREY and the HOUND enter.

JOFFREY: Sansa.

TYRION: Always been a great romantic, my nephew

JOFFREY: Sansa, come here.

SANSA: I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

TYRION: Will you?

SANSA: Just as I pray for the king

SANSA walks away.

TYRION: Stay safe, my lady.

SHAE: And you, my lion

PODRICK and TYRION exit

JOFFREY: Your king You should see him off with a kiss.

He draws his sword and presents it.

JOFFREY: My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it.

SANSA leans down and kissed the blade.

JOFFREY: You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.

SANSA: Will you slay him yourself?

JOFFREY: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

SANSA: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?

JOFFREY: A king

SANSA: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.

JOFFREY: Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.

JOFFREY and the HOUND exit

SHAE: Some of those boys will never come back.

SANSA: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.

SHAE:  Shh. Come, my lady.

EXT. THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL

The soldiers buzz with activity. JOFFREY enters, along with TYRION, the HOUND and LANCEL. A horse gallops through, and some townsfolks scurry past. They climb the stairs to the top of the exterior wall all look out into the empty harbor.

LANCEL: Where's our fleet?

TYRION: On the way.

JOFFREY: Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

TYRION does not answer.

JOFFREY: Hound, tell the Hand that his king

HOUND: The king

TYRION: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the kingthat the Hand The Hand

JOFFREY: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.

TYRION: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

CUT TO: STANNIS'S FLEET

DAVOS: Where are their ships?

MATTHOS: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.

DAVOS: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.

MATTHOS: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.

DAVOS: Maybe.

CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST

CERSEI and TOMMEN join the  highborn ladies.  They walk past SHAE and SANSA.

SANSA: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.

SHAE: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.

SANSA: I doubt it.

SHAE: Maybe she's jealous of you.

SANSA: Why would she be jealous?

CERSEI: Sansa.

SANSA gets up and walks over to her.

CERSEI: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?

SANSA: Yes.

CERSEI: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

A servant pours the wine. CERSEI hands it to SANSA.

SHAE: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

CERSEI: So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here?

CERSEI: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.

SANSA: But we have guards to defend us.

CERSEI: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

A door opens and a gold cloak walks in. He bows to CERSEI.

MAN: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

CERSEI: The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.

He bows and moves to ILYN PAYNE, then exits the chamber.

CERSEI: The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.

SANSA: You said he was here to protect us.

CERSEI: He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.

CUT TO: THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR

TYRION, JOFFREY, the HOUND and LANCEL look out across the foggy sea.

JOFFREY: There they are.

TYRION: Archers to their marks.

SOLDIER:  Archers, to your marks!

The archers set their bows.

SOLDIER: Archers! Nock your arrows!

SOLDIER #2: Nock arrows!

TYRION: Hold fast.

SOLDIER: Hold fast!

JOFFREY: What are you doing? We need to attack them.

TYRION: Hold fast.

SOLDIER: Boulders ready!

SOLDIER #2: Hold fast!

There is but one ship sailing out of the harbor.

JOFFREY: There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?

CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET

MATTHOS and DAVOS watch the lone ship approaching

MATTHOS: There's only one ship.

DAVOS: Archers, stand to! Man the below! - Nock.

The soldiers get set.

MAN: Nock and set!

DAVOS: Draw! Hold.

MAN: Hold.

They watch the ship sail by. It is unmanned.

DAVOS: (confused) There's no one on board.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR WALL

MAN: More rocks coming up!

HAYLENE climbs the stairs. TYRION looks back at him. HAYLENE lights a torch and hands it to TYRION.

CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET

MAN: Hold.

As the empty ship sails past, DAVOS sees that it is spewing green liquid into the sea behind it

DAVOS: Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!

CUT TO: HARBOR WALL

TYRION throws the torch over the side of the wall. BRONN gets the signal, lights his arrow ablaze and launches it high into the sky.

CUT TO: BARATHEON FLEET   The flaming arrow soars over DAVOS's boat and hits the wildfire in the water, which erupts in green flame. The flames crawl towards the ghost ship.

DAVOS: Matthos! Get down!

A huge explosion. The ghost ship explodes ferociously, overwhelming MATTHOS and many other soldiers. STANNIS recoils from the blast

CUT TO: HARBOR WALL

JOFFREY shields his eyes from the blast. HAYLENE seems pleased. The HOUND is resolute.

CUT TO: HARBOR

BRONN watches the explosions.

CUT TO: BARATHEON FLEET  The explosion engulfs the fleet. Meet scream in agony, devoured in green flame, some jumping overboard. The immensity of the explosion is stunning. Chaos ensues on board as the ships collapse.

CUT TO: HARBOR WALL

TYRION, PODRICK, the HOUND and JOFFREY watch. HAYLENE smiles. TYRION is horrified.

CUT TO: BARATHEON FLEET

STANNIS's ship is unharmed. He gets to his feet and surveys the massive destruction. Men scream, masts collapse.

STANNIS: Prepare to land.

SOLDIER: Your Grace.

STANNIS: The dwarf has played his little trick.

SOLDIER: The wildfire.

STANNIS: He can only play it once.

SOLDIER: We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers Hundreds will die.

STANNIS: Thousands.

STANNIS descends from the upper deck and addresses his troops.

STANNIS: Come with me and take this city!

The men yell in agreement.

CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST

CERSEI is a bit drunk, and still drinking wine.

CERSEI: Sansa, come here, little dove.

SANSA: My queen What are you doing? Praying.

CERSEI: You're perfect, aren't you?

SANSA: Praying.

CERSEI: What are you praying for?

SANSA: For the gods to have mercy on us all.

CERSEI: Oh. On all of us?

SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Even me?

SANSA: Of course, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Even Joffrey?

SANSA: Joffrey is my

CERSEI: Oh, shut up, you little fool Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father My mother I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother I was four.

SANSA: Your father

CERSEI: He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.

CERSEI holds out a glass for her servant to fill.

CERSEI: One for her.

The servant pours the wine. She hands it to SANSA.

CERSEI: Here. Sit. Drink.

SANSA sits and takes a sip of wine.

CERSEI:  Not like that. Drink, girl

SANSA takes a bigger gulp.

CERSEI: I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.

SANSA: They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.

CERSEI:  It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.

SANSA: And if the city should fall?

CERSEI: You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.

SANSA is speechless.

CERSEI: Have I shocked you, little dove The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.

They both drink.

CERSEI: Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

CERSEI takes a drink, and SANSA joins her, panicking.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR

Landing boats from the ships row towards the shore.

MAN: More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!

CUT TO: THE HARBOR WALL

TYRION: He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

JOFFREY: They're coming. They're coming ashore.

TYRION: Rain fire on them.

MAN: Archers!

JOFFREY: There are too many.

TYRION: Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.

PODRICK: Yes, my lord.

CUT TO: BELOW THE HARBOR WALL

HOUND: Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too.

The HOUND punches LANCEL in chest as he walks past. LANCEL is stunned.

HOUND: Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR

MEN: Pull, pull! Go!

CUT TO: THE HARBOR WALL

The archers prepare to fire.

SOLDIER: Nock! Draw!

MEN: Draw!  Draw!

CUT TO: THE HARBOR

STANNIS's men have reached the shore.

MEN: Kill the Lannisters!

CUT TO: THE HARBOR WALL

MEN: Loose! - Loose!

The archers let their flaming arrows fly.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR

The arrows land as the soldiers rush from the boats to the shore.

MAN: Form the line!

The arrow land. Some hit there mark. Some Baratheon men fall while others pour ashore.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR WALL

MEN:  Draw!  Draw!  Loose! Loose!

The archers release more salvos. STANNIS's forces take heavy casualties, but they do not give up. Yelling, the first of them make it to base of the harbor wall. Above them, Lannister forces drop rocks, which crush the skulls of the unlucky. STANNIS himself gets sprayed with the blood of his bludgeoned soldier. They place their shields above their heads.

STANNIS: To the Mud Gate, go now!

MEN: First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!

CUT TO: INSIDE THE HARBOR WALL

The HOUND leads a charge of Lannister men.

HOUND: Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse. He and LANCEL engage with the sieging forces. They each cut down a number of Baratheon men before LANCEL is struck in the chest by an arrow. He stumbles and screams. Panting, he retreats.

INT. MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST

CERSEI: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.

SANSA: You were Robert's queen.

CERSEI: And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.

CERSEI walks over to SHAE.

CERSEI: Pretty.

SHAE rises and curties.

CERSEI: That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.

CERSEI demonstrates and SHAE mimics her.

CERSEI: Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?

SHAE: A few weeks, Your Grace.

CERSEI sits, still a bit drunk.

CERSEI: When did you leave Lorath?

SHAE is confused.

CERSEI: I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

SHAE: (smiles)

CERSEI: But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?

SHAE: Ten years ago, Your Grace.

CERSEI: From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?

SHAE: Shae, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Tell us a story, Shae.

SHAE: When I was 13, I

A door opens. LANCEL stumbles in past the guards.

LANCEL: Your Grace!

CERSEI: What news?

LANCEL: The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.

CERSEI: Where is Joffrey?

LANCEL: On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

CERSEI: Bring him back inside at once.

LANCEL: Your Grace

CERSEI: What?

LANCEL: The king

CERSEI: Bring him back to his chambers now.

LANCEL: Not here?

CERSEI: With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?

LANCEL: No, but I

CERSEI: Now!

LANCEL exits. CERSEI sits, requesting more wine. She turns to SANSA.

CERSEI: When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.

SANSA looks at ILYN PAYNE.

EXT. THE HARBOR SHORE

The HOUND decimates his foes as the chaos of battle continues. Both sides take brutal casualties. A flaming man runs screaming towards the HOUND, who is frozen by the horror of the sight. An arrow takes down his assailant. The HOUND looks up to see that he has BRONN to thank.

MAN: Help me!

BRONN quickly dispatches some more Baratheon men with his knife. The HOUND is in a bit of a daze, overwhelmed by the fires, reliving his own trauma. He turns and re-enters the gates. Many of the Lannister forces follow.

MAN: Fall back! Fall back!

CUT TO: STANNIS ON THE HARBOR SHORE

Stannis continues to be trapped under his shield at the base of the wall.

STANNIS: Get the ladders up!

His forces bring ladders to the wall. They set them, and STANNIS begins to climb, dodging rocks. He makes it to the top and engages with the Lannister forces atop the wall.

CUT TO: COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL

MAN: Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!

The HOUND is still in a daze.

HOUND: Someone bring me a drink.

A soldier hands him a skin. He drinks and spits it out.

HOUND: Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

Another soldier gives him wine, and he drinks deeply. He shuffles though the courtyard, passing TYRION

TYRION: Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

HOUND: Eat shit, dwarf.

TYRION: You're on the wrong side of the wall.

HOUND: I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.

JOFFREY: Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.

The HOUND looks down, defeated.

TYRION: You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king

HOUND: Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king

The HOUND exits.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR

More boats come ashore. The soldiers overturn the boat to use it as protection from the arrows.

MAN:  Loose!

MAN #2: Put your backs into it!

MAN #3: All right, get up!

MAN: Loose!

MAN #2: Clear!

MAN #3: Forward!

MAN: Loose!

While the overturned boat makes slow progress, another group of men with a battering ram overtakes them and reaches the wall.

MAN: Forward ladders!

Another ladder is raised against the wall. The boat is placed over the ram. Meanwhile, men are crushed by thrown rocks.

MEN: Heave! Heave!

CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL

LANCEL runs to join the royal group.

LANCEL: Your Grace, the queen

TYRION: If you won't defend your own city, why should they?

JOFFREY: What would you have me do?

TYRION: Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.

JOFFREY: What did my mother

LANCEL: She did not say, Your Grace.

JOFFREY hesistates.

MAN: All men to the battlements!

JOFFREY: Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncleand represent the king

MANDON: (nods)

MAN: Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.

JOFFREY and LANCEL exit. A bundle of stones is mismanaged at the top of the wall, and it comes crashing down.

MAN: Stand fast!

MAN #2: No! Get up, you fool.

MAN #3: We need more arrows!

The Lannister men gather in the courtyard, looking for direction.

MAN: Where is the king?  Why isn't he with us?

MAN #2: Who are we fighting for?

MAN #3: Who leads us?

PODRICK ascends the stairs to TYRION

TYRION: I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!

MAN: Yes.

MAN #2:  What are you talking about?

TYRION: Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?

MAN: The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.

TYRION: There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.

CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL

The battering ram pounds relentlessly into the wooden door.

MEN: Heave! Heave!

CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL

TYRION: Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.

CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL

The battering ram is making progress.

MEN: Heave! Heave! Heave!

CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL

TYRION: Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.

The Lannister forces raise their swords and shout in support. TYRION strides off, and they follow.

CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST

CERSEI and TOMMEN sit. LANCEL reports.

LANCEL: The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.

CERSEI: Where is my son

LANCEL: I want to escort him back to the battle.

CERSEI: Why do I care what you want?  Bring me

LANCEL: Now listen to me

Enraged, CERSEI leaps up and stabs LANCEL, who falls to ground, writhing and screaming in pain. She walks over him, and exits with LANCEL. The women begin to panic.

SANSA:  Don't be afraid. The queen This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...

ALL: Save our sons from war, we pray

SHAE grabs SANSA from behind, startling her.

SHAE: You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

SHAE indicates ILYN PAYNE, who stands guard.

SANSA: Come with me.

SHAE: I need to say goodbye to someone.

SANSA: The queen

SHAE: No one is raping me.

SHAE reveals a dagger bound her her calf, beneath he dress.

SHAE: Go. Run.

SANSA turns and exits qucikly.

CUT TO: SANSA'S CHAMBERS

SANSA moves fleetly through the corridor. She enters her chambers and bolts the door. She picks up a doll.

HOUND: The lady is starting to panic.

She turns around in fright to find the HOUND sitting quietly in the corner.

SANSA: What are you doing here?

HOUND: Not here for long. I'm going.

SANSA:  Where?

HOUND: Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be.

SANSA: What about the king

HOUND: He can die just fine on his own.

The HOUND takes a drink.

HOUND: I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.

The HOUND stands.

HOUND: I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?

SANSA: I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.

The HOUND stumbles forward. SANSA whispers.

HOUND: Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father Your brother Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.

SANSA: You won't hurt me.

HOUND: No, little bird

The HOUND turns and unlocks the door. SANSA considers whether to join him.

CUT TO: THE SEWERS

TYRION uses his axe to remove the chain from the sewer's gate. He steps out onto the shore and the Lannister men follow quietly.

CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL

The battle rages. The ram has made further progress. Flaming arrows still rain down.

MEN: Heave!

MAN: Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!

TYRION comes up behind the man and slices his ankle wide open. He falls and Tyrion lands another heavy blow, blood spurting. He then rallies his men forward, coming behind the Baratheon forces.

TYRION: Attack!

Their surprise attack is successful, and they quickly dispatch the vulnerable men.

MEN:  Roll it over!

They overturn the boat, and someone above drops a torch inside to set it aflame. They all celebrate with a resounding cheer.

ALL: Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

TYRION turns around to see a host of soldiers coming upon them from the short. The battle begins again.

TYRION: Oh, fuck me.

CUT TO: ATOP THE WALL

STANNIS continues to wage brutal war agains the Lannister men atop the wall

CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL

TYRION battles a  with a mace. The soldier gains the advantage, but is then tackled by one of TYRION's men. He smiles, while a MANDON MOORE notices him and walks forward. He swings his sword at TYRION, and slices open his cheek. TYRION reels. Suddenly, a spear pierces the MANDON's face. He falls to reveal PODRICK wielding the fatal weapon. TYRION goes into shock, and PODRICK catches him

CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM

CERSEI and TOMMEN sit in the dark on the iron throne.

CERSEI: Shh! Be calm, my sweet.

TOMMEN: They're still fighting.

CERSEI: No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.

TOMMEN: The Kingswood?

CERSEI: Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.

TOMMEN: Like what?

CERSEI: Like stags.

TOMMEN: Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.

CERSEI: And wolves.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE

PODRICK holds TYRION, who remains in shock.

PODRICK: My lord.

Another wave of soldiers approaches from the shore. Some are mounted.

CERSEI: He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, "You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid.

Stannis looks down from his perch. The mounted soldiers attack.

CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM

CERSEI: "For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE

The battle rages. The mounted soldiers have the advantage.

CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM

CERSEI: " And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

CERSEI uncorks the vial she holds.

CERSEI: "Yes," said his mother. "You will be strong and fierce just like your father."

CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE

TYRION passes out

CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM

CERSEI presents the vial for TOMMEN to drink.

CERSEI: " I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."

The chamber door burst open and CERSEI and TOMMEN stand. Soldiers march in. LORAS TYRELL takes off his helmet.

CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE

The Baratheon forces are in retreat.

MAN: Back to the boats!

STANNIS: Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!

Men grab STANNIS and restrain him.

STANNIS: No!

CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM

TYWIN enters

CERSEI: Father.

She drops the vial, spilling its deadly contents. The vial shatters.

TYWIN: The battle is over. We have won.

CERSEI: (cries)

CREDITS

MALE SINGER: "And who are you," the proud lord said "That I must bow so low?" / "Only a cat of a different coat "That's all the truth I know / "In a coat of gold or a coat of red "A lion still has claws / "And mine are long and sharp, my lord /  "As long and sharp as yours" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke /  That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear
INT. KING'S LANDING

TYRION wakes to echos of the sounds of battle. PYCELLE's face comes into focus. TYRION's head is crudely bandaged, with only one eye revealed. He is disoriented.

TYRION: Pod.

PODRICK bursts into the room

TYRION: Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.

PODRICK: Yes, my lord.

PYCELLE: Would you like something for the pain?

TYRION: What happened?

PYCELLE: The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father

TYRION: Where am I?

PYCELLE: These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand

PYCELLE turns and begins to leave. A thought occurs to him. He takes out a coin and flicks it to Tyrion

PYCELLE: Oh, For your trouble.

Pycelle exits.

CUT TO : THRONE ROOM

A white horse expels manure at the doorway leading to the throne room. TYWIN rides the horse in, through the gathered crowd.  From his throne, JOFFREY addresses the room.

JOFFREY: I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfatherTywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand

Bowing, a page presents a pillow to JOFFREY, who places the Hand's brooch up to TYWIN. TYWIN bows

TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace.

He turns his mount and exits.

JOFFREY: Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

LITTLEFINGER steps forward and kneels before JOFFREY.

JOFFREY: For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.

LITTLEFINGER: You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.  The crowd laughs

JOFFREY: Ser Loras Tyrell.

LORAS steps forward from the crowd and kneels.

JOFFREY: Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.

LORAS: Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses.

JOFFREY: Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

MARGAERY takes a few steps forward.

MARGAERY: With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.

JOFFREY: I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king

CERSEI: Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a manbeheaded for treason, a girlwhose brother For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.

The crowd murmurs.

CROWD: Margaery! We want Margaery!

JOFFREY stands and gestures to quiet the crowd.

JOFFREY: I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.

PYCELLE: Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.

CERSEI looks across to SANSA. CERSEI is pleased and SANSA is quite worried.

JOFFREY: The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister You will be my queen

The crowd applauds.

SANSA walks away, quite solemn. Once she is out of view, she smiles and laughs in relief. LITTLEFINGER catches up to her.

LITTLEFINGER: My lady. My sincerest condolences.

SANSA: They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

LITTLEFINGER: You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.

SANSA: But, if he's not marrying me

LITTLEFINGER: He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.

SANSA: King's Landing is my home now.

LITTLEFINGER: Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.

CUT TO : BROTHEL

ROS applies make-up to her eye. There is a knock on the door. ROS stands up to welcome her client.

ROS: Come in. Make yourself comfortable.

A hooded figure walks in, silently. He sits on the end of the bed.

ROS: That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me.

The man removes his hood. It is VARYS.

VARYS: No need for that, my dear.

ROS: You sure? Most men like what they see.

VARYS: I'm not like most men.

ROS: That's what most men say.

VARYS: (laughs)

ROS: If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.

VARYS: I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.

ROS: Have we met?

VARYS: You wouldn't remember me if we had?

ROS: I meet a lot of men.

VARYS: And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.

ROS: You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor.

ROS reaches to fondle his cock, but finds that VARYS is a eunuch. She is taken aback, and steps backward.

VARYS: You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

ROS: I know who you are.

VARYS: And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.

ROS: How do you know about that?

VARYS:  I thought you said you knew who I was.

ROS: What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

VARYS: Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.

ROS: I'm afraid of him.

VARYS: Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.

EXT. WESTERLANDS SHORE

BRIENNE pulls the boat up to the shore. JAIME waits, his hands chained.

JAIME: You're a virgin, I take it?

Annoyed, BRIENNE pushes him forward. He walks and she follows.

BRIENNE: Walk.

JAIME: Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne. BRIENNE" One or two tried.

JAIME: Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.

BRIENNE:  Not interested.

JAIME: Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.

They encounter three hanged women in the trees.

JAIME: Ah. "They lay with lions." Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

JAIME: Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.

BRIENNE pushes him roughly below the bodies, finally pinning him against a tree, and tying him fast against it.

JAIME: What are you doing?

BRIENNE: Burying them.

JAIME: We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.

BRIENNE: I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.

Some men approach

MAN: I didn't leave it here.

MAN #2: I had me dagger.

JAIME, nervously, gesters to BRIENNE.

JAIME: Untie me. Now!

MAN: I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.

Three men approach, in leather armor and bearing swords.

MAN: So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?

BRIENNE: Traveling a prisoner

The three men laugh hysterically

MAN: You're a woman. - A woman!

MAN #2: Well, fuck me!

BRIENNE: If you've quite finished up

The men laugh even harder.

BRIENNE: All right, we'll be going.

She turns to take care of JAIME.

MAN: Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?

BRIENNE: The Starks. MAN #2 What did he do?

JAIME: Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?

BRIENNE: No, stealing is a crime.

JAIME: But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.

MAN: Where are you taking him?

BRIENNE: To Riverrun.

MAN #2: Why Riverrun?

BRIENNE works to unbind JAIME from the tree.

BRIENNE: Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.

MAN #2: Why not kill him?

JAIME: For stealing a pig?

BRIENNE: I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.

MAN: Sending him with you? How important could he be?

BRIENNE does not answer.

MAN: All right, have it your way, my lady.

MAN #2 moves closer.

MAN #2: Do I know you?

JAIME: Have you been to Ashemark?

MAN #2: No.

JAIME: Then you don't know me.

MAN #2: Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?

JAIME: Is it near Ashemark?

MAN #2: No.

JAIME: I've never been there.

BRIENNE frees him from the tree, and she and JAIME start to walk away.

MAN: What do you think of these beauties?

BRIENNE: I hope you gave them quick deaths.

MAN: Two of them we did, yeah.

MAN #2: Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.

JAIME: I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

BRIENNE: If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.

MAN: How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?

MAN #2: I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king

BRIENNE: He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

Again, they try to move along.

MAN: I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.

BRIENNE pushes JAIME aside, draws her sword, and sets on the men, visciously. JAIME is surprised at her prowess in battle. She bests them all, and turns to MAN, who lies on the forest floor. She drops her long sword and draws her short sword.

BRIENNE: Two quick deaths.

She stabs the MEN in the gut, painfully. She plunges deeper, and the MAN dies. She withdraws her sword and steps away.

JAIME: Those were Stark men.

BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.

BRIENNE turns and chops the rope that holds the three women's corpses with a large grunt. JAIME winces as the bodies thud to the ground.

INT. RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.

ROBB sits in his tent. Catelyn sits as well.

CATELYN: Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

ROBB: I know that.

CATELYN: And you mean to do it anyway?

ROBB: I love her.

CATELYN: I know that seems important to you.

ROBB: It is important to me.

CATELYN: Your father He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.

ROBB: And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters,  what you and father

CATELYN: Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?

ROBB: Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.

CATELYN: And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father

ROBB: My father And the only parent

Robb exits.

INT. BARATHEON WAR CAMP AT NIGHT

STANNIS sits by a hearth.

STANNIS: You said you saw my victory in the flames.

MELISANDRE: l I did. I still see it.

STANNIS:  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?

MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

STANNIS: You claimed to speak for a god.

MELISANDRE: Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?

STANNIS: You talk about war as if you understand it.

MELISANDRE: I've been fighting far longer than you.

STANNIS: Have you? Show me how you fight.

STANNIS leaps to his feet and starts choking MELISANDRE. She gasps painfully, grabbing his hands.

STANNIS: Show me.

MELISANDRE removes her hands from his and raises them in surrender.

STANNIS: Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?

MELISANDRE: Inside you.

STANNIS releases her suddenly and MELISANDRE falls to the follow, panting.

STANNIS: I murdered my brother

MELISANDRE walks over to STANNIS.

MELISANDRE: We murdered him. Share the weight with me.

STANNIS: He wasn't your brother

MELISANDRE caresses his head, soothingly.

MELISANDRE: This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king

STANNIS: You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know.

MELISANDRE: Let me show you.

She leads him over to the fire.

MELISANDRE: Look into the fire, my king Look.

STANNIS:  I see fire.

MELISANDRE: Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king

STANNIS stares into the fire. His eyes grow wide and his face softens. MELISANDRE rests her head on his shoulder. Stannis: Yes.

INT. WINTERFELL

THEON throws another log onto his fire, and sits before it, frustrated. A lone horn blows outside the gates of Winterfell.

THEON: I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.

LUWIN: They want you to know you're surrounded.

THEON: I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.

LUWIN: They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before

THEON: Thank you, wise bald man Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

The horn continues.

THEON: No word from my father

LUWIN: No.

LUWIN crosses the room, and rests.

THEON: Send more ravens.

LUWIN: You killed all the ravens.

THEON: The first time I saw Winterfell

The horn blows again. THEON rolls his eyes in anger.

THEON: First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, "Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. "We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."

LUWIN: Lord Stark

THEON: Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father

The horn sounds again. THEON gets up in a fury. He shakes his fist at the window.

THEON: I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

LUWIN: Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you.

THEON: And what's your counsel, trusted friend

LUWIN: Run.

LUWIN: Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.

THEON: There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.

THEON sits again.

LUWIN: Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.

LUWIN leans over THEON's shoulder.

LUWIN: Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven.

THEON: I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.

LUWIN: There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...

LUWIN faces THEON

LUWIN: The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.

THOEN rises.

THEON: The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.

LUWIN: The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.

THEON: I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.

LUWIN: I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet.

THEON: You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

LUWIN comforts him with a gentle pat on the shoulder.

EXT. WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING

THEON stands in the Winterfell courtyard, addressing his men.

THEON: You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.

The ironborn men laugh

THEON: They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.

MEN: Aye!

THEON: You think they're right?

BLACK LORREN: Aye.

THEON: We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.

MEN: Aye!

THEON: Mothers will name their sons for us.

MEN: Aye!

THEON: Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.

MEN: Aye!

THEON: And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!

MEN: Aye!

THEON: What is dead may never die!

MEN: What is dead may never die!

DAGMER hits THEON on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The ironborn watch him fall.

BLACK LORREN: Thought he'd never shut up.

DAGMER: It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.

A man placed a hood over THEON's head.

LUWIN enters.

LUWIN: What is this? What are you doing?

DAGMER stabs LUWIN in the gut with his spear. LUWIN crumbles to the ground, groaning in sharp pain.

DAGMER: Let's go home.

MAN: Come on.

DAGMER and the ironborn exit, dragging THEON with them. LUWIN collapses.

INT. TYRION'S CHAMBERS

TYRION sits in bed, his face still bandaged

TYRION: Why should I believe you?

VARYS: Why would I lie about it?

TYRION: To create strife between my sister

VARYS: Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister If it weren't for your squire

TYRION: Pod.

PODRICK: Yes, my lord?

TYRION: Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?

PODRICK: No, my lord.

TYRION: You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.

PODRICK: (nods)

VARYS: I'm afraid your friend The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your fatheror your sister It varies from cloak to cloak.

TYRION: Then my hill tribesmen.

VARYS: Have gone home. Your father I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.

TYRION: Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.

VARYS: We are. Podrick, would you mind?

PODRICK opens the door and SHAE enters briskly. She comes to TYRION's side and sits.

VARYS: There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king

VARYS bows.

VARYS: Come along now, Podrick.

VARYS and PODRICK exit.

SHAE: My love.

TYRION: It was good of you to come.

SHAE: Good of me? Of course I come.

SHAE reaches to adjust TYRION's bandages, but he prevents her.

SHAE: I want to see you.

TYRION: Believe me, you don't.

SHAE: Have you looked?

TYRION: (shakes his head)

SHAE: I will be the first.

She removes the bandages. They stick to the deep wound across TYRION's cheek. He grunts in pain. SHAE takes in the wreck of his cheek.

TYRION: Well?

SHAE: You are a mess.

TYRION: I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.

SHAE:  You think I'm here for money?

TYRION: That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.

SHAE: Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave.

TYRION: Leave?

SHAE:  Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here.

TYRION: What would we do in Pentos?

SHAE: Eat, drink, fuck, live.

TYRION: I want to go with you.

SHAE: So do it. Your fatheryour sister Forget about them. Come with me.

TYRION: I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?

SHAE: You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.

TYRION bursts into tears. SHAE envelops him in her arms. TYRION holds her as well.

EXT. THE RIVERLANDS

A SEPTON marries ROBB and TALISA to one another.

SEPTON: In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words.

ROBB: Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.

TALISA: Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.

ROBB: I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.

TALISA: I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.

They kiss.

EXT. QARTH

DAENERYS, JORAH and KOVARRO walk through a garden. It is known.

KOVARRO: (dothraki) A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.

They come to the base of the House of the Undying.

KOVARRO: Where are the guards?

JORAH: No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

DAENERYS: Let them try.

They ascend the first flight of stairs, and gaze up to the top of the tower. They cannot find an entrance.

DAENERYS: Is this a riddle?

They circle the base. DAENERYS disappears from JORAH's view. He encounters KOVARRO instead.

JORAH: Khaleesi! Khaleesi!

CUT TO: INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING

DAENERYS stands in darkness. She picks up a torch from the wall.

DAENERYS: Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?

A dragon screeches. DAENERYS follows the sound up a stairwell.

EXT. SHADOWLANDS

ARYA, GENDRY and HOT PIE trek through the Shadowlands. High above them, JAQEN stands atop a steep cliff.

HOT PIE: How did he find us?

As they pass to the other side of the cliff, JAQEN disappears. Suddenly, he is at ground level, next to ARYA.

ARYA: What are you doing here?

JAQEN: Waiting for you.

ARYA: How did you know we'd come this way?

They begin to walk.

JAQEN: After all the things you have seen, this is your question?

ARYA: How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?

JAQEN: No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way. Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.

JAQEN: If you would learn, you must come with me.

ARYA: Where?

JAQEN: Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

ARYA: My dancing master was from Braavos.

JAQEN: To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one.

ARYA: I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brotherand mother And my sister I need to find her, too.

JAQEN: Then we must part. A man

He offers a coin.

ARYA: What is it?

JAQEN: A coin of great value.

ARYA: Could it buy a horse?

JAQEN: It is not meant for the buying of horses.

ARYA: Then what good is it?

JAQEN: If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, "Valar Morghulis."

ARYA: Valar Morghulis.

JAQEN begins to walk away

ARYA: Please don't go, Jaqen.

JAQEN: Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis.

ARYA: Valar Morghulis.

JAQEN: Good.

JAQEN turns away and touches his hand to his face. When he turns back, his face has changed completely.

JAQEN: Farewell, Arya Stark.

JAQEN exits.

EXT. WINTERFELL

OSHA, BRAN, HODOR and RICKON leave their hiding place and enter the courtyard.

BRAN: Osha, what are you doing?

They walk through the smouldering courtyard, among bodies and wreckage. They spy Summer and Shaggydog, whimpering in an alcove. BRAN commands HODOR to bring him that way.

EXT. THE GODSWOOD OF WINTERFELL

LUWIN lays by the godswood, dying. HODOR, BRAN, OSHA and RICKON walk toward him. Rickon starts to run, and OSHA cannot catch him. LUWIN reaches out, happy to see him and BRAN. RICKON notices the great bloodstain on LUWIN's shirt.

BRAN: Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.

RICKON: We'll make you better. LUWIN I feel just fine.

RICKON: (cries)

BRAN: They burned it down. They burned everything.

LUWIN: Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.

OSHA: North's the wrong way. And motherand brother We don't know where.

LUWIN: There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother

BRAN: I don't want to leave you.

LUWIN: No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here.

The four of them get up to leave, but OSHA steps back.

LUWIN: Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.

OSHA: I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it. LUWIN I don't want milk of the poppy.

OSHA shows LUWIN her knife, and he nods his asent.

LUWIN: Do it quickly.

OSHA draws her blade while looking LUWIN in the eyes.

EXT.  WINTERFELL

Summer and Shaggydog walk across the fields. OSHA, RICKON, HODOR and BRAN follow. BRAN is in a cart. Behind them, Winterfell burns.

INT. HOUSE OF THE UNDYING

DAENERYS continues to search for her dragons. She follows the sound of their screeching through a door. She looks down into a pit before trying a door on the opposite side of the chamber. She goes through and the wind whistles. The large chamber has a broken roof, and snow falls. She sets down her torch, and ascends to a stage with a throne. Dragons screech again, and she does not touch the snowy throne. She walks toward the noises, and a large portal door opens before her. She exits, finding herself in a land of snow and ice. She sees a lone tent in the distance. She walks to it.

INT. TENT

DROGO sits, holding their son Rhaego

DROGO: (dothraki) Moon of my life.

DAENERYS cannot believe her eyes. She walks closer.

DAENERYS: (dothraki)  This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.

DROGO: (dothraki) Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.

DAENERYS: That sounds like something you would do.

DAENERYS sits next to DROGO, and she caresses RHAEGO's head.

DROGO: (dothraki) Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.

DROGO And DAENERYS stare deeply into one another's eyes.

DROGO: (dothraki) You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.

They touch foreheads and DROGO caresses her face, gently.

DROGO: (dothraki)  And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me.

DAENERYS looks down at RHAEGO. Dragons screech.

DAENERYS: Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

She caresses DROGO's face and touches RHAEGO one more time. Then DAENERYS gets up a quickly walks away. DROGO is heartbroken.

INT. HOUSE OF THE UNDYING

When DAENERYS leaves the tent, she finds herself back in the House of the Undying. Her three dragons sit on a pedestal. They call out to her, excited. She walks closer, and holds out a hand for them

PYATT PREE: They miss their mother.

DAENERYS turns around, startled. Behind her, another PYATT PREE clone watches while she looks at the one who spoke. The two PYATTs share the dialog, speaking with one mind.

PYATT PREE: They want to be with you.

PYATT PREE: Do you want to be with them?

PYATT PREE: You will be.

PYATT PREE: When your dragons were born,

PYATT PREE: our magic was born again.

PYATT PREE: It is strongest in their presence.

PYATT PREE: And they are strongest in yours.

A third PYATT PREE appears in an alcove.

PYATT PREE: You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again. Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them.

The sound of chains turning starts to her right.

PYATT PREE: And we will be with you until time comes to an end.

DAENERYS finds that her wrist is chained. PYATT PREE tightens the chain that binds her. DAENERYS is confused. Another PYATT PREE pulls on a chain now attached to her other wrist. Her arms are now outstreched and straining.

PYATT PREE: Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

DAENERYS: This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.

PYATT PREE: They will be waiting a long time.

DAENERYS turns to look at her dragons. PYATT PREE peers down at them. DAENERYS turns back to the warlock.

DAENERYS: Dracarys.

The dragons breath smoke. Then one spurts out a burp of fire. It catches PYATT PREE's sleeve, and he starts to panic. All three dragons spit fire, past DAENERYS who experiences the ecstasy of the fire. PYATT PREE is consumed by flame. He screams horrible, and falls to the ground. DAENERYS looks back to her dragons. The chains break.

EXT. THE FAR NORTH  The wildings lead the captive JON and QHORIN on a march. YGRITTE playfully tortures JON by batting him with his sword, with the RATTLESHIRT walking behind her.

YGRITTE: We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go.

JON: Careful with that. You might cut yourself.

YGRITTE swings the sword again, JON feints and she misses.

JON: Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.

RATTLESHIRT: Enough of that!

YGRITTE challenges JON. QHORIN uses the distraction to punch his captor in the face, and steal his sword. He pushes by RATTLESHIRT and attacks JON. JON falls.

JON: Stop!

Two wildlings hold QHORIN back.

QHORIN: Why, traitor

RATTLESHIRT: Let 'em fight.

YGRITTE drops JON's sword for him. The wildlings release QHORIN, who charges at JON. He tries to grab his sword while scrambling away from the attack. He gets to his feet, and they battle fiercely. QUORIN forces JON to stumble into two wildlings, who push him back into the fight.

QHORIN: That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.

QHORIN attacks again. JON counters.

QHORIN: Your traitor father

JON goes on the attack, but QHORIN parries.

QHORIN: Or was it your whore mother?

QHORIN headbutts JON, who falls. He gathers himself and charges, disarming QHORIN. He runs Quorin through.

QHORIN: We are the watchers on the Wall.

QHORIN falls, dead.

YGRITTE: You can tell Mance that's the man

Rattleshirt takes the sword from JON, and then slices through his bounds.

RATTLESHIRT: Burn the body.

WILDLING: Aye.

RATTLESHIRT: You don't want this one coming back for you.

RATTLESHIRT exits and YGRITTE comes to JON's side.

YGRITTE: Come along, Jon Snow.

They walk together to the edge of the cliff.

YGRITTE: Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

She walks down the slope. JON looks back to see the wildlings burning QHORIN's body. He follows YGRITTE.

INT. QARTH

XARO sleeps with DOREAH next to him. A curved sword hooks his amulet and steals it away. XARO awakes startled and sits up.

XARO: What the

JORAH, DAENERYS, KOVARRO and the Dothraki have entered his bedroom. DOREAH sits up next to XARO

DOREAH: Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

DAENERYS: Come.

DAENERYS turns and walks. XARO makes a sudden move, but JORAH draws his sword and keeps him motionless.

CUT TO: XARO'S SAFE

KOVARRO uses the amulet to open the vault's door. JORAH helps him to open the door. DAENERYS enters first. The vault is empty.

DAENERYS: Nothing.

She turns around

DAENERYS: Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

The Dothraki push XARO and DOREAH forward into the vault.

XARO: I am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. I'll bring you a thousand ships.

DOREAH: Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

XARO: All that you have dreamed is within your reach!

The Dothraki close the vault door behind the pair.

DOREAH: I beg you, please!

XARO: Khaleesi.

DOREAH: Please! Please!

XARO: Khaleesi!

JORAH shuts the door and locks it. He hands the amulet key to DAENERYS.

CUT TO: DINING ROOM

They are looking for things to loot.

JORAH: It's all a lie.

DAENERYS hands him a golden vase.

DAENERYS: Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?

JORAH: Aye, a small ship.

DAENERYS walks away.

JORAH: (dothraki) Take all the gold and jewels.

The Dothraki cheer, and being to loot the palace. DAENERYS walks lovingly with her dragons.

EXT. THE NORTH

GRENN, EDDISON TOLLETT and SAM continue to labor in the cold and snow.

GRENN: I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.

GRENN finds a piece of dung.

GRENN: Is this goat?

EDDISON TOLLETT takes it, placing it in his basket.

EDDISON TOLLETT: It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.

GRENN: Well, you see a tree, let me know.

They continue to dig.

SAM: If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is

GRENN: Just bloody kill me.

SAM: No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.

EDDISON TOLLETT: The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.

SAM: And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.

A horn blows in the distance.

SAM: It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.

The horn blows again

GRENN: Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.

The horn blows a third time.

EDDISON TOLLETT: Come on.

GRENN: Three blasts?

EDDISON TOLLETT: Run!

GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT flee. SAM is slower to follow.

SAM: Wait! Wait for me!

SAM falls, spilling his basket.

SAM: Grenn!

GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT are running further away, not waiting or helping.

SAM: Edd!

SAM stands. There is a high-pitches squeal. SAM sees figures coming towards him. He hides behind a large boulder. The figures comple closer, walking slowly. They are undead and decaying with blue eyes. An undead horse stops next to sam. A white walker rides it, and he notices SAM. SAM begins to sob. The white walker shrieks and orders his undead followers forward. There are scores of them, a seeminly endless. onslaught. Another white walker is mounted behind. He also gives the order forward.
[Opening Credits]

[First scene shows the location of Casterly Rock (ancestral seat of House Lannister) on a giant map of Westeros. There are several game pieces representing different House sigils located on different parts of the map. ROBB STARK and CATELYN STARK are at a campsite, within a tent lit up by candles]

CATELYN: Are you sure about this?

ROBB: No.

CATELYN: It's dangerous.

[ROBB nods in agreement]

ROBB: If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.  Take his home, take his gold, take his power.

CATELYN: Why are you telling me?

[ROBB pauses then walks around CATELYN]

ROBB: You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.

[ROBB pours himself something to drink]

ROBB: Now Winterfell is burned to the ground.  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.

[ROBB pauses]

ROBB: So, Casterly Rock?  I'm asking your advice.

[CATELYN pauses, staring at ROBB.  She then looks at the map]

CATELYN: We have enough men?

[ROBB grabs a House Frey piece]

ROBB: If Walder Frey cooperates.

CATELYN: If Walder Frey cooperates.

[Close up shots of the map showing the sigils of House Stark, House Frey and House Lannister]

CATELYN: If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.

[ROBB moves the House Frey piece to the House Stark side of the map]

ROBB: We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.

[A flash of anger spreads across CATELYN's face]

CATELYN: Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

The next scene shows ROBB'S direwolf, Grey Wind, as he leads House Stark's army to The Twins castle, the ancestral seat of House Frey.  [The scene shifts to the inside of The Twins, as a servant walks around with a plate of bread and salt in observation of the Westerosi tradition of "Guest Right".  ROBB, his wife TALISA MAEGYR, his uncle EDMURE TULLY, his great uncle BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY, CATELYN and the Stark army are in the presence of WALDER FREY and his family.  ROBB takes a piece of bread, dips it into the salt and eats it while looking intently at WALDER]

WALDER: My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table.  I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.

ROBB: We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

[Servant stops in front of WALDER.  He takes a piece of bread from the plate and eats it]

ROBB: I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

WALDER: Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace.  It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls.

[WALDER signals for his female relatives to appear before ROBB]

WALDER: One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are.

[As WALDER calls each relative by name, they briefly look up at ROBB]

WALDER: This is Arwyn, my daughter.  My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.

[WALDER pauses to chew]

WALDER: My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.

[EDMURE intently watches the Frey women]

WALDER: Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.  You could have had either.  Could have had both for all I care.

[EDMURE closes his eyes after hearing WALDER'S comments about his granddaughters]

WALDER: My granddaughter Marianne.  My granddaughter Freya.  My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?

[WALDER guessing at his granddaughter's name.  EDMURE raises his eyebrows]

MERRY: I'm Merry.

WALDER: Fine.  And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.  Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.

[ROBB looks at the Frey women]

ROBB: My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.

[WALDER claps to signal the dismissal of the Frey women]

WALDER: Very good.

[WALDER focuses on TALISA]

WALDER: There she is.  Come closer, let me have a look at you.

[TALISA takes a couple of steps towards WALDER.  WALDER moves forward in his seat and squints]

WALDER: Still can't see you.  Old eyes.

[TALISA looks at ROBB who nods.  Frey men look on as she takes a couple more steps towards WALDER.  She bows her head]

WALDER: Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.

[WALDER leans forward with a grin]

WALDER: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch.

[WALDER grins, ROBB visibly uncomfortable]

WALDER: Your king says he betrayed me for love.  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.

[ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him]

WALDER: And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.

[ROBB visibly angry]

ROBB: Thank you, my lord.

[WALDER stands up and claps]

WALDER: Well, let's get ready.  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.

[Scene changes to the desert outside of the city of Yunkai on the continent of Essos.  An army of Unsullied are standing guard outside of DAENERYS TARGARYEN'S tent.  Inside her tent are her closest advisers: DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM.  They are looking at a map of Yunkai]

DAENERYS: Where?

[DAARIO points at a location on the map]

DAARIO: There.

[DAARIO gets closer to DAENERYS, grabs and guides her hand to the location he was referring to.  JORAH watches him closely]

DAARIO: There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

JORAH: Your men but not you?

DAARIO: I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.

[DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her]

DAARIO: This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside.

BARRISTAN: We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.

DAARIO: I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.

[DAARIO nods at JORAH and GREY WORM.  JORAH looks at GREY WORM who briefly looks back]

DAARIO: Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.

JORAH: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.

DAARIO: You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.

[JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm]

JORAH: You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?

DAENERYS: [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nmzme za, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.

GREY WORM: [In Valyrian] I trust him.

DAENERYS: [Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight.

JORAH: Very good.  We'll prepare.

[DAENERYS' advisers start to leave.  DAARIO grins at DAENERYS who looks back at him.  BARRISTAN walks towards JORAH]

BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.  You can use an extra sword.

JORAH: You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.  Your place is by the Queen.  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done.  No matter the cost, no matter our pride.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene shifts to Beyond The Wall in the North.  SAMWELL TARLY, GILLY and her baby are walking south towards Castle Black]

SAMWELL: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do.

[GILLY stops and looks at SAMWELL in a confused manner]

GILLY: How do you know all that?

SAMWELL: I read about it in a very old book.

GILLY: You know all that from staring at marks on paper?

SAMWELL: Yes.

GILLY: You're like a wizard.

[SAMWELL smiles.  Next shot, GILLY and SAMWELL gaze up at the Wall]

GILLY: Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.  Here we are.  Alive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes to SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE and ARYA STARK on horseback in the Riverlands, on their way to The Twins, where THE HOUND plans on returning ARYA to her mother and brother in the hopes of receiving some reward.  They see a PIG FARMER along the way who's having trouble with the wheel spokes on his cart]

THE HOUND: Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

[THE HOUND hands the horse reins to ARYA and walks over to the PIG FARMER]

PIG FARMER: The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.

THE HOUND: Need a hand?

PIG FARMER: Need about eight hands.

[THE HOUND lifts the cart up]

PIG FARMER: Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.

[PIG FARMER fixes the wheel, THE HOUND sets the cart down]

PIG FARMER: Many thanks.

[THE HOUND punches the PIG FARMER in the face, knocking him to the ground.  THE HOUND then unsheathes his dagger and prepares to kill him, prompting ARYA to intervene]

ARYA: Don't! Don't kill him.

THE HOUND: Dead rats don't squeak.

ARYA: You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are.

THE HOUND: More than anyone you know.

ARYA: You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.

THE HOUND: That so?

ARYA: You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.

[THE HOUND looks at the PIG FARMER on the ground]

THE HOUND: That him?

[Confused, ARYA turns her head to look down at the PIG FARMER]

ARYA: No.

THE HOUND: Good.

[THE HOUND again tries to approach the PIG FARMER in order to kill him but ARYA again intervenes pushing him back]

ARYA: Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.

[THE HOUND pauses then sheathes his dagger]

THE HOUND: You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.

[PIG FARMER starts to regain consciousness.  ARYA grabs a piece of wood from the cart and hits him across the face with it, knocking him out again.  She then walks back to the horse as THE HOUND looks on surprised]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes to the North, south of the wall.  BRAN STARK, RICKON STARK, HODOR, JOJEN REED, MEERA REED and OSHA are walking past a windmill]

OSHA: Where are we?

BRAN: The Gift, I think.  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Nights Watch for their sustenance and support.  Maester Luwin taught me that.

JOJEN: Doesnt seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.

MEERA: Its good land and theres no war up here.  Why leave?

BRAN: Wildlings.

[BRAN looks at OSHA who stares back at him]

BRAN: Sorry.  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.

RICKON: Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.

[OSHA stares at RICKON who looks back at her]

RICKON: Thats what Old Nan said.

JOJEN: Theres a storm coming.

BRAN: I dont see any.

[Thunder rumbling, everyone looks up at the sky and at the windmill]

MEERA: Its as good a place to shelter as any.

[They begin walking back towards the windmill.  OSHA puts her hand on RICKONS head]

OSHA: We can drink some blood while we wait.  I dont need much.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes showing ORELLS eagle circling over an old horse breeders home.  JON SNOW, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, ORELL, YGRITTE are hiding, waiting for ORELLS scouting report]

ORELL: Only one old man and eight good horses.

TORMUND: Whats one old man doing with eight horses?

JON: He breeds them for the Watch.

YGRITTE: Hows he keep folks from stealing them?

JON: The Watch protects him.

ORELL: Not today they dont.  Hes selling horses, hes got some gold in there.

TORMUND: And proper steel.

ORELL: Lets carve him up.

JON: We just take the horses and go.  The old mans no threat.

[ORELL looks at TORMUND]

ORELL: I keep telling you.

[YGRITTE looks at JON]

YGRITTE: Hes an old man.  A spear through the hearts a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.

[JON looks at TORMUND]

JON: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  Theyll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

TORMUND: I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, thats what we do.

[TORMUND announces to the rest of the wildlings]

TORMUND: Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.

[The wildlings run towards the OLD MANS home.  JON smacks his sword, Longclaw, against a rock to alert the OLD MAN and his horses. Upon hearing his horses moving about, the OLD MAN steps outside and sees the wildlings running towards his home.  He gets on one of the horses and starts riding off.  YGRITTE preps her bow and arrow, aiming for the OLD MAN]

JON: Ygritte!

[JON intervenes and YGRITTE hits a tree instead]

TORMUND: Clear the barn!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes to ARYA looking at The Twins.  Theyre relatively close.  Meanwhile, THE HOUND eats pig feet by the cart.  ARYA walks back to THE HOUND]

ARYA:  No ones going to believe youre a hog farmer if you eat them all.

[THE HOUND waves a pigs foot at ARYA]

THE HOUND: Best part of the animal.

[THE HOUND continues to eat while ARYA gazes back at the Twins]

THE HOUND: Dont worry, theyre still there.

[ARYA angrily turns back and looks at THE HOUND]

ARYA: I know theyre still there.

THE HOUND: You check every five minutes like youre afraid theyre gonna move.

ARYA: Im not afraid.

THE HOUND: Of course you are.  Youre almost there and youre afraid you wont make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot.

ARYA: I knew fear when I saw it in you.  Youre afraid of fire.

[THE HOUND pauses]

ARYA: When Berics sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.

[ARYA moves in closer to THE HOUND]

ARYA: And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like youre a nice juicy mutton chop.

THE HOUND: That give you some ideas?

[ARYA turns her back to THE HOUND]

ARYA: Might do.

THE HOUND: Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  Theyre just over the river.  The closest youve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddys neck.

[ARYA turns around and angrily stares at THE HOUND]

ARYA: Someday Im gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.

[THE HOUND stares back at ARYA as she walks away to get a closer look at the Twins as thunder rumbles in the sky]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes back to BRAN and company inside of the windmill.  The storm has already begun]

BRAN: How are we going to get past the Wall?  My uncle said its 700 feet high.

[OSHA looks at Bran and he looks at her]

BRAN: How did you get past it?

OSHA: Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

BRAN: It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.

OSHA: Some climb straight up the ice.

[BRAN looks at HODOR]

BRAN: Even Hodors not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

[HODOR visibly scared of the thunder]

HODOR: Hodor!

JOJEN: Nineteen castles guard the Wall.  Only three are still manned.

[HODOR still shaken from the thunder]

Hodor: Hodor!

JOJEN: One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.

BRAN: My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.

[MEERA looks at Bran]

MEERA: Well, well have to open them up again.

[MEERA gazes outside and sees the OLD MAN on horseback]

OLD MAN: [From outside] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

MEERA: Theres a rider out there.

JOJEN: Just one?

[Thunder rumbles]

MEERA: Theres more.

HODOR: Hodor!

[Horses neighing outside.  OSHA tries to quiet down HODOR]

OSHA: Its just thunder, sweet giant.

HODOR: Hodor.

OLD MAN: [From outside]  I yield.  I yield.

JOJEN: Wildlings.

[OSHA starts turning her head then gazes outside]

OSHA: [To BRAN and RICKON]  Wheres Shaggydog and Summer?

BRAN: Hunting.

[Thunder rumbles]

HODOR: Hodor!

[HODOR stands up]

JOJEN: Shhh, quiet, Hodor.

HODOR: Hodor!

JOJEN: [To BRAN] Make him shut up.  If they hear us

BRAN: [To Hodor] Hush, Hodor.  No, no more Hodoring.

[OSHA tries to hold HODOR back but he pushes her aside and starts yelling and moving around anxiously]

HODOR: Hodor!

[HODOR continues Hodoring]

BRAN: Hodor, calm down.

OSHA: You need to keep quiet.

JOJEN: Theyre gonna hear us.

[HODOR continues Hodoring.  ORELL hears voices coming out of the windmill.  He stops and looks up]

BRAN: Hodor, be quiet.

[HODOR continues Hodoring]

BRAN: Hodor, calm down.  Hodor, be quiet!

[BRANS eyes roll back as he wargs into HODOR.  HODOR stops making noises as he falls to his knees and then falls asleep on the ground.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill from the outside.  Inside of the windmill, everybody is in shock at what just happened]

MEERA: [To BRAN] What did you do?

Bran: Nothing.  I dont know.

[The sound of a horse is heard from outside.  OSHA gets near the windmill opening]

RICKON: Whats That?

OSHA: Thats a horse dying.

[Scene shifts to the wildlings who are outside of the windmill with the OLD MAN.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill]

WILDLING 1: Bring them over here.

WILDLING 2: That was the last of them.  The rest are dead.

ORELL: [To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.

TORMUND: Thunder.

ORELL: I know the difference between shouting and thunder.

TORMUND: Maybe it's ghosts.

[ORELLs eagle is seen circling over the windmill.  TORMUND approaches the OLD MAN who is sitting on the ground.  He pulls a knife out on TORMUND, YGRITTE gets her bow and arrow out and aims for the OLD MAN]

TORMUND: That wont help you, grandpa.

[TORMUND sticks his hand out, asking for the knife.  The OLD MAN gives it to TORMUND, who tosses it aside]

TORMUND: Where you riding?

OLD MAN: Doesnt matter now, does it?

TORMUND: No, it doesnt matter now.

ORELL: Cut his throat or hell tell the crows were here.

[TORMUND unsheathes his sword]

TORMUND: You understand.

OLD MAN: Let me stand at least.

[BRAN and RICKONS direwolves, Shaggydog and Summer, are seen hiding behind a cart, outside of the windmill]

OLD MAN: Let me go with a bit of dignity.

[TORMUND helps the OLD MAN get up.  He then gets in position for the kill]

Orell: [Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON]  Youre one of us now.  Prove it.

[YGRITTE, TORMUND and the OLD MAN stare back at JON.  The scene changes to back inside of the windmill]

Jojen: [Looks at BRAN]  The wolves are out there.

BRAN: I cant do it by choice.  I dont know how.  It happens in my dreams.

JOJEN: Youre a warg, Bran.  Its in your blood.

BRAN: I cant.

JOJEN: You just did, with him.

[JOJEN looks at HODOR who is still resting]

JOJEN: A wolf is nothing compared to that.

[Scene switches back to outside of the windmill.  JON unsheathes Longclaw.  He places his sword against the OLD MANS neck]

OLD MAN: She looks sharp.

[JON nods his head.  The OLD MAN closes his eyes and starts praying, JON hesitates]

YGRITTE: [Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.

[JON looks back at YGRITTE]

ORELL: Told ya.  Hes still one of them.

TORMUND: Go on, boy.

[JON glares back at TORMUND]

TORMUND: Go on!

[JON raises his sword but hesitates. YGRITTE shoots the OLD MAN in the chest with an arrow, killing him.  This prompts ORELL and TORMUND to reach for their swords]

ORELL: Hes a crow.  Hell always be a crow.  And heres his crow wife guarding him.  Hell stab us in the back first chance he gets.

[JON and YGRITTE are standing side by side in defensive positions]

TORMUND: Kill him!

[YGRITTE prepares to shoot an arrow at either ORELL or TORMUND but JON pushes her to the ground first.  JON, ORELL and the other wildlings have a sword fight while TORMUND runs towards YGRITTE.  She starts yelling and screaming as TORMUND tries to restrain her]

Tormund: Hes one of them!

YGRITTE: No!

TORMUND: Do you hear me?

[YGRITTE bites TORMUNDS arm which causes him to lose his grip on her.  She starts running away but TORMUND grabs her and tackles her to the ground]

TORMUND: Youre not gonna die for one of them.

[Scene switches back to inside of the windmill.  Everybody is looking at BRAN]

JOJEN: Do it.  Theyll find us if you dont.

[BRANS eyes roll back as he wargs into Summer.  Scene goes back outside to JON fighting the wildlings.  Suddenly, the direwolves start attacking the wildlings.  JON continues fighting ORELL until he impales him with Longclaw]

JON: You were right the whole time.

[JON twists his sword as ORELL wargs into his eagle right before dying.  The eagle attacks JON, biting and scratching his face.  JON tosses the eagle aside and makes a run for one of the OLD MANS horses.  He starts riding away as TORMUND and YGRITTE look on]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The scene changes to Yunkai.  DAARIO, JORAH and GREY WORM are outside of the back gate]

DAARIO: When you hear a songbirds whistle, you come.  Im a great whistler, the greatest in the land.

[DAARIO approaches the back gate, a guard yells at him in Valyrian]

DAARIO: Daario Naharis.

[The guard lets DAARIO in as JORAH and GREY WORM wait.  In the distance, DAARIO whistles.  JORAH and GREY WORM go through the back gate and into Yunkai.  They see two dead guards and DAARIO sitting down]

DAARIO: That one was quick.

[DAARIO wiping blood off his arakh, a Dothraki blade]

JORAH: There may be others.

DAARIO: I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.

[Suddenly, theyre surrounded by Yunkai guards.  A brief fight ensues.  DAARIO throws a knife by JORAHS head, killing a Yunkai guard who was behind him.  The trio defeat the first wave of guards]

JORAH: [Addressing DAARIO] Thats what you call a few guards?

[DAARIO smiles at JORAH as more Yunkish guards appear, surrounding the trio]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The scene changes to right outside of The Twins, where the Stark army are set up in tents and passing the time with some wrestling.  It then switches to inside of The Twins, at the wedding ceremony of EDMURE and WALDERS daughter, ROSLIN FREY. WALDER walks the bride to the altar, her face is covered with a veil.  EDMURE is standing at the altar, looking worried, as ROBB and his family are looking on.  ROBB turns his head back towards WALDER and ROSLIN, while ROOSE BOLTON stares at ROBB.  As WALDER approaches, he trades glances with ROBB.  When WALDER and ROSLIN finally reach the altar, he removes her veil.  EDMURE'S fear of an ugly bride are put to rest when he finally sees how beautiful ROSLIN is.  ROSLIN gets down on her knees in front of EDMURE]

ROSLIN: Lord Edmure, I hope Im not a disappointment to you.

[EDMURE helps ROSLIN up]

EDMURE: Youre a delight to me, my lady.

[ROSLIN smiles]

SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.

[EDMURE removes his cloak as he goes behind ROSLIN to drape it over her shoulders.  ROSLIN and ROBB trade glances.  ROBB then looks at WALDER who gives him a strange look before grinning.  EDMURE finishes putting the cloak on ROSLIN, then looks at CATELYN who smiles at him.  He walks back to ROSLINS side and the SEPTON ties EDMURE and ROSLIN'S hands together]

SEPTON: In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.  Look upon each other and say the words.

[EDMURE and ROSLIN turn to each other]

EDMURE & ROSLIN: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.  I am hers (I am his) and she is mine (he is mine) from this day until the end of my days.

[BLACKFISH looks at the ugly Frey women who smile back at him.  He quickly turns around]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene changes to inside of the windmill.  Its nighttime.  OSHA lights a candle]

MEERA: Is that safe?

OSHA: Theyre long gone.

BRAN: [Looks at JOJEN] You were right.  I can get inside Summers mind whenever I want.

JOJEN: Of course you can.  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.  But you did a lot more than that.  You got inside Hodors mind.

[Shot of HODOR still resting]

BRAN: They cant do that north of the Wall?

JOJEN: No one can do that.  Anywhere.

BRAN: [Looks at RICKON]  When I was looking through Summers eyes, I saw Jon.

RICKON: Where?

BRAN: He was with the wildlings.  They tried to kill him but he got away.

OSHA: Hell be heading back to Castle Black then.  Thats where we should go.

BRAN: For all we know, Castle Blacks already under attack.  If this many wildlings got through-

OSHA: I already told you.  Im not going north of the Wall.

BRAN: Everything Jojen told me is true.  You saw what I did to Hodor.  I have to find the three-eyed raven.

[OSHA grabs BRAN by the hand]

OSHA: Listen to me, little lord.

BRAN: Dont worry, Im not asking you to come with me.  It wont be safe for Rickon.

RICKON: [Surprised] Me? Im coming with you.

BRAN: No.  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.  The Umbers are our bannermen.  Theyll protect you.

RICKON: Im coming with you.  Im your brother.  I have to protect you.

BRAN: Right now, I have to protect you.

[RICKON'S eyes start tearing up]

BRAN: Robbs at war and Im going beyond the Wall.  If something happens to us, youre the heir to Winterfell.

[RICKON shakes his head with tears in his eyes]

BRAN: [Looks at OSHA]  Will you know how to find the last Hearth?

OSHA: You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.  Youre easy to find.

[RICKON stands up and looks at OSHA]

RICKON: Were not Southerners.

[RICKON turns around to look at BRAN]

RICKON: And I dont want to leave you.

OSHA: Shhh.  [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap]  Come here, little soldier.  You and me, were gonna have some adventures.

[RICKON starts crying.  BRAN looks at OSHA]

Bran: You dont have to do any of this.

[RICKON cries as OSHA strokes his hair]

OSHA: Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.  [To RICKON] Shhh.  Well be fine, you and me.  The Umbers are great warriors.  Even I heard about them growing up.  Theyll teach you how to swing a sword.

RICKON: [Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword.

[OSHA strokes RICKONS hair and kisses him on the head.  She then gets up and helps RICKON up as well]

BRAN: Youre leaving now?  Its the middle of the night.

OSHA: I learned to walk in darkness.

[OSHA kisses RICKON on the head again]

OSHA: Say your good-byes, little man.

[RICKON walks one step before dropping to his knees to give BRAN a tight hug.  The Reeds look at BRAN and RICKON and then switch their gaze to OSHA]

Osha: [Looks at the Reeds] Keep this one safe.  [MEERA gives a slight nod]  He means the world to me.

[Final shot of BRAN and RICKON hugging followed by a shot of OSHA and RICKON exiting the windmill, with Shaggydog leading the way]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene shifts to DAENERYS tent outside of the city of Yunkai.  Its nighttime and there are Unsullied soldiers surrounding the tent.  The next shot is inside of the tent.  BARRISTAN is having a drink, MISSANDEI presents some food to DAENERYS who is sitting down.  She suddenly gets up and ignores the food, as she approaches BARRISTAN with impatience]

Daenerys: Weve been waiting a long time. [BARRISTAN looks at her]  Havent we?  [BARRISTAN shrugs]  Well I dont know, you tell me.  How long does it take to sack a city?

[BARRISTAN briefly ponders the question before JORAH, GREY WORM and several Unsullied guards arrive.  JORAH and GREY WORM are both tired and covered in blood]

JORAH: [Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.

[DAENERYS likes the news but her face suddenly shows some worry]

DAENERYS: And Daario Naharis?

[JORAHS face goes from a smile to a look of shock.  Suddenly, DAARIO emerges from behind the Unsullied guards, with a Yunkai flag draped over his shoulder and his face covered in blood.  He walks towards DAENERYS and drops to one knee.  He drapes the flag over his knee and looks up at DAENERYS]

DAARIO: The city is yours, my queen.

[DAENERYS starts to smile]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The scene shifts to the wedding celebration inside of The Twins.  A band is playing music on the balcony of the hall.  WALDER is seated on the high chair at the main table, underneath the balcony where the musicians are playing.  Seated to his left are ROSLIN and EDMURE.  Seated to his right is his wife, JOYEUSE FREY.  Stark men and Frey men and women are celebrating the marriage.  TALISA is seated at a table towards the front, near WALDER'S main table.  Next to her is LOTHAR FREY, one of WALDER'S many sons]

TALISA: [Looking at the band and talking to LOTHAR] Theyre good, arent they?

LOTHAR: They ought to be because they cost enough.

[ROBB takes a drink and starts laughing.  Next shot is from across the hall, where ROOSE, BLACKFISH and CATELYN are seated, enjoying themselves]

BLACKFISH: Look at the crowd there.

[Seated next to BLACKFISH is WENDEL MANDERLY of House Manderly.  Next to him is BLACK WALDER FREY, another one of WALDER'S sons]

CATELYN: [Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.

[Shot of EDMURE whispering in ROSLIN'S ear as she smiles]

BLACKFISH: The Gods love to reward a fool.

CATELYN: [Laughs] Uncle.

BLACKFISH: What? Hes my nephew, I love him.  And hes a damned fool.

[CATELYN and BLACKFISH both laugh.  A servant tries to pour some wine into ROOSE'S cup but he covers it with his hand before she can pour anything.  CATELYN looks at ROOSE]

CATELYN: Dont you drink, Lord Bolton?

ROOSE: Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses.

BLACKFISH: Thats the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didnt you marry one of these Frey girls?

ROOSE: Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girls weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride.

[ROOSE smiles and BLACKFISH laughs.  CATELYN gives ROOSE a serious look]

CATELYN: I hope she makes you very happy.

ROOSE: Well, shes made me very rich.

BLACKFISH: Pardon, my lord, my lady.  I need to find a tree to piss on.

[BLACKFISH gets up from his seat and begins exiting the hall, as ROBB and TALISA look on]

ROBB: My mothers alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.

TALISA: Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman Ive ever met.

ROBB: Be kind.  Shes finally starting to like you.

TALISA: And I like her.  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Freys hand.

ROBB: Perhaps Ive made a terrible mistake.

[TALISA gasps and tries to strike ROBB but he catches her hand]

ROBB: Striking your king is an act of treason.

[ROBB and TALISA look at each other before ROBB tries to kiss her.  TALISA stops him]

TALISA: No, dont.  Dont insult them.

WALDER: [Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear] Your Grace.

[Everybody starts knocking on the tables.  WALDER signals for the music and knocking to stop]

WALDER: The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.  But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?

EVERYBODY: [Knocking on the tables, chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!

ROBB: [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.

[Everybody cheers, the band starts playing celebratory music again.  EDMURE smiles, ROSLIN looks concerned.  Men start getting up from their seats and approach the main table]

EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!

[The men pick up ROSLIN and carry her out of the hall.  The women grab EDMURE and start bringing him out as well. TALISA looks worried when she sees ROSLIN being carried away.  Everybody is cheering on.  The men start removing some of ROSLIN'S clothes while the women start doing the same to EDMURE]

EDMURE: Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies.  Once you set that monster free, theres no caging him again [Laughs].

[ROBB looks on smiling and clapping.  TALISA looks at ROBB with a worried look]

EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!

[ROOSE and CATELYN look at ROSLIN and EDMURE being carried out of the hall]

CATELYN: Poor girl.

ROOSE: Every bride suffers the same.  Im sure you endured yours with grace.

CATELYN: Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldnt be right if he broke a mans jaw on our wedding night.

[ROOSE looks at CATELYN and chuckles before walking away]

[ROBB and TALISA watch as the bedding procession is almost finished]

TALISA: That is a very strange custom.

ROBB: I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigners perspective.

TALISA: It seems normal to you?

ROBB: Its tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, theres no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.

[TALISA puts her hand on ROBB'S shoulder, runs it down his arm, before grabbing his hand and placing it on her stomach]

TALISA: No, but there are other ways of providing proof.

ROBB: Boy or girl?

TALISA: I dont know.  But if its a boy, I know what we should name him.

ROBB: Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his sons naming.

TALISA: Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Dont you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?

ROBB: I do.

[ROBB and TALISA kiss.  CATELYN looks on and smiles as BLACK WALDER walks towards the door of the hall to close it.  He walks back and the band starts playing the Lannister song, The Rains of Castamere.  The bands expression is very serious and the song isnt as cheerful as their previous songs.  CATELYN looks up at the band with a worried expression.  Scene changes to outside of The Twins, Grey Wind is locked up in a kennel, whimpering, sensing something is wrong as Frey soldiers are on the move.  The scene then changes again to the main gate of The Twins, where the tents are set up and men are still celebrating. THE HOUND and ARYA approach the gate, riding the pig farmers cart]

THE HOUND: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[Three Frey guards stop THE HOUND and ARYA from entering The Twins]

FREY GUARD: Where are you going?

THE HOUND: Got salt pork for the feast.

FREY GUARD: The feast is over.

THE HOUND: It doesnt sound like its over.

[ARYA watches as Frey soldiers run into the Twins]

FREY GUARD: If I tell you its over, its over.  [Angrily] Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.

THE HOUND: Got pigs feet, too [ARYA looks up].

FREY GUARD: [Infuriated] Are you soft in the head?  Turn this cart around!

[THE HOUND gives up.  As he looks back, he notices that ARYA is not in the cart.  The scene then switches back to the hall inside of The Twins.  WALDER signals for everybody to be quiet.  He addresses ROBB]

WALDER: Your Grace.

[WALDER stands up with a cup in his hand.  Everybody takes a seat except ROBB.  ROOSE returns to the hall and sits next to CATELYN]

WALDER: I feel Ive been remiss in my duties.

[CATELYN looks scared.  ROOSE slowly turns his head to look at CATELYN.  He's smiling as he looks down at his arm, inviting CATELYN to take a look]

WALDER: Ive given you meat and wine and music but I havent shown you the hospitality you deserve.  My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

[CATELYN pulls back ROOSE'S sleeve, she sees that hes wearing chainmail.  She starts gasping as ROOSE stares at her.  She suddenly gets up from her seat and slaps ROOSE across the face, prompting him to run to the other side of the hall]

CATELYN: Robb!

[LOTHAR pulls a knife out of his sleeve and repeatedly stabs TALISA in the stomach from behind.  She starts screaming as ROBB looks on in horror.  As ROBB starts to approach her, the band now have crossbows and they shoot arrows at Robb, hitting him.  The rest of the Frey men in the hall start slaughtering the Stark men.  ROBB is repeatedly shot with arrows and falls to the ground.  TALISA falls to the ground in agony.  CATELYN in shock over ROBB, gets hit in the shoulder by an arrow, making her fall down.  As the massacre continues, WALDER smiles and sips from his cup.  The scene then switches to ARYA sneaking into The Twins.  She hides behind a barrel and watches some Stark men eating with Frey men in front of the kennel that Grey Wind is in]

MAN 1: [Laughing] You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh? [Men laughing]

[ARYA grins]

MAN 2: Feast over yet, is it?

FREY MAN: Aye, its over! [Slits the throat of a Stark soldier]

[The Frey men kill the Stark men.  They flip over the table and march off as ARYA hides in the shadows of the barrels.  ARYA can hear Grey Wind whimpering as he tries to break out of the locked kennel.  She goes behind the flipped over table and sees Grey Wind jumping up and down.  Suddenly, Frey men appear with crossbows.  Grey Wind growls at them before they shoot him to death.  ARYA is horrified.  She watches as Grey Wind takes his last breath and dies.  She then notices more Frey men emerging from a doorway.  She starts walking towards the doorway until THE HOUND puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her around]

THE HOUND: Its too late.

[THE HOUND hits ARYA on the back of the head, knocking her out.  He carries her over his shoulder and starts exiting The Twins.  The scene then changes to CATELYN crawling underneath the table at the hall with the arrow still lodged in her shoulder.  She notices JOYEUSE hiding underneath the main table.  ROBB gazes at TALISA laying on the ground with her hand on her bloodied stomach.  He starts crawling towards her.  WALDER notices and signals for everybody to stop]

WALDER: The King in the North arises, heh heh.

[ROBB places one hand on TALISA'S stomach and lifts her head up with his other hand.  She has already died.  CATELYN grabs a dagger and emerges from under the table.  She grabs JOYEUSE by the hair and drags her out from under the main table.  CATELYN presses the dagger against JOYEUSE'S throat as WALDER looks on.  The archers fix their sights on CATELYN]

CATELYN: Lord Walder!  Lord Walder, enough!  Let it end!  Please!  He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor]  My first son!  Let him go and I swear that we will forget this!  I swear it by the Old Gods and New!  We will take no vengeance.

WALDER: [Angrily] You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.  You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!

[ROBB lays TALISA'S head on the ground]

CATELYN: Take me for a hostage but let Robb go!  Robb, get up! Get up and walk out!  Please!  Please!

WALDER: And why I would let him do that?

[CATELYN straightens up and presses the dagger harder against JOYEUSE'S neck]

CATELYN: On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wifes throat!

[ROBB starts to stand up]

WALDER: Ill find another.

[ROBB turns to CATELYN]

ROBB: Mother.

[CATELYN turns to ROBB with tears in her eyes as ROOSE suddenly reappears in front of ROBB.  He faces ROBB and grabs him by the shoulder]

ROOSE: The Lannisters send their regards.

[ROOSE thrusts a dagger into ROBB'S heart. While still staring at CATELYN, ROBB dies and collapses to the floor next to TALISA.  CATELYN wails loudly while WALDER takes a sip from his cup.  She slits JOYEUSE'S throat with the dagger, killing her.  JOYEUSE falls to the ground with blood spraying from her neck and CATELYN drops the dagger.  She looks on hopelessly, in a dreary daze.  After a long pause, BLACK WALDER finally emerges behind CATELYN and slits her throat, killing her.  She falls to the floor with blood spraying from her neck]

[Cut To Black]

[End Credits.  No music]
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow? Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.
When they stop being shy, they get angry.
And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
- Crow! - Crow! - Look over there! - Crow! Crow! Look over here! Look! Ah, look, crow coming! Crow! You're wearing the wrong color.
Mance was a ranger.
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
When I'm free, will I be free to go? - Crow! - Crow! Sure, you will.
Oh! And I'll be free to kill you.
Got no respect, this lot.
Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.
What happened to their fathers? Some of them were killed by crows like you.
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.
If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.
And if he don't I smell a crow.
We killed his friends.
Thought you'd want to question this one.
What do we want with a baby crow? This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.
He wants to be one of us.
That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.
Friends twice your size.
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.
And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods.
- What's your name, boy? - Jon Snow.
Your Grace.
Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.
Stand, boy.
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.
Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.
You can leave us.
The girl likes you.
You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us? Don't panic, boy.
This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
He was my brother once.
Back when he had a whole hand.
What were you doing with him? The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
Why? He wants me to lead one day.
But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.
If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I want to be free.
No, I don't think so.
I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.
I'll ask you one last time-- why do you want to join us? We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.
I saw You saw what? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
I saw what took it.
You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers? Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.
Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them.
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
Did I come to the right place? We'll need to find you a new cloak.
What if you took off that bit there? Don't you want to leave something to the imagination? Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.
I want you to take it off.
Mouth.
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.
I didn't hear that.
- Apologies, ser.
- Back away.
Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.
I will murder you, boy.
He said it was a matter of life and death.
- Pod? - It's your sister.
The queen.
What are they doing here? Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in? No, I don't think so.
If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me? They stay outside.
I'm not afraid of you, little brother.
- Why are you here? - I wanted to see your face.
They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
I should hope so.
The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.
Thanks to Father.
Thanks to Father.
Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.
No? Curious.
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.
But then I don't suppose you need much room.
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.
You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
You're meeting Father today? How do you know that? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.
Father told me.
What do you want from him? What do I want from him? He's my father.
Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy.
Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing.
I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
You're going to make me cry.
Why do you care what I want from him? Because you've slandered me to Father before.
Slandered? When? You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
You did have your guards beat her.
A girl of nine, I believe.
I was nine, too.
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
It's not slander if it's true.
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today? Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father? Because you're a liar.
I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
Any lies in particular? You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.
Still makes me more clever than you.
Oh, look at these two shining warriors.
Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.
Ser Meryn Trant.
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
- You're no knight.
- Pod.
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.
That's exactly who I am.
And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.
You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.
As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.
A number of people in this city want to kill me.
You're here to protect me.
I've been doing that for a while now.
Do you grow bored protecting me? I grow poor protecting you.
Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.
And now my pockets are empty.
You've given me a taste for the finer things.
And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
- How much? - Double.
- Double? - I'm a knight now.
Knights are worth double.
I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
Which means you can afford it.
Here.
Here! Help me! Who are you? I was in the battle at Blackwater.
I was a captain and a knight.
Aye, ser, and serving which king? The one true king of Westeros-- Stannis Baratheon.
I thought you were dead.
Everyone thought you were dead.
And your son? He may have swam ashore as you did.
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.
I'm so sorry, my friend.
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.
But, Davos, you were a good father.
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.
Stannis lives? He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
Will you take me there? There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
This war is not over.
Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
We're both sworn to King Stannis.
I am sworn to no man.
I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.
I delivered the ships.
Stannis never gives up.
Never.
- Now he will regroup-- - He's a broken man.
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
They say he sees no one-- not his generals, not even his wife.
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
What? They built a great fire when Stannis returned.
All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.
They say she sang to them as they burned.
I'm a pirate.
You're a smuggler.
Servants of darkness.
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
Take me back there, please.
You cannot turn Stannis against her.
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
You could try.
If you fail, they will burn you.
If you succeed, they'll burn you.
And you've only just come back to life.
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.
And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.
I have to stop her.
Please, do this for me.
When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.
We should set the siege lines There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.
I don't think we're going to get one.
slaughtered like sheep.
The debt will be repaid, my friend.
For them and for your sons.
Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.
My best hunters are after him.
- A Mallister? - Ser Jeremy.
My father's bannerman.
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
She's your mother.
She freed Jaime Lannister.
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
Water.
Water.
This needs to be cleaned and closed.
What's your name, friend? Qyburn.
You're lucky to be alive.
Lucky? The badge looks good on you.
Almost as good as it looked on me.
Are you enjoying your new position? Am I enjoying it? I was very happy as Hand of the King.
Yes.
I heard how happy you were.
You brought a whore into my bed.
It wasn't your bed at the time.
I sent you here to advise the king.
I gave you real power and authority.
You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
What do you want, Tyrion? Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.
I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.
I bled in the mud for our family.
And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell.
But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
Jugglers and singers require applause.
You are a Lannister.
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion.
So tell me what you want.
I want what is mine by right.
Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.
The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.
I am your son and lawful heir.
You want Casterly Rock? It is mine by right.
We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay.
And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.
And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
- Why? - Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.
Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.
And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.
But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.
Go, now.
Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.
Go.
Oh, one more thing.
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.
Dorne.
It's going to Dorne.
- Why Dorne? - It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.
But it's not coming back.
The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.
He's going to stay in Dorne.
Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
Don't ruin the game.
I told you, I don't want to play.
What about that one there? That one? It's going to Volantis.
Why? Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
That's not how the game works.
You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.
You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
Why should I make up a story when I know the truth? Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
Lovely day for it.
Watching the ships.
Lord Baelish.
Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment? I saw your mother not long ago.
She's very eager to see you.
And your sister.
Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
You said King's Landing was your home.
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.
If you were to tell just one person-- - I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know? Because I'm a terrible liar.
You said so yourself.
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me.
But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
You're her handmaiden? Yes.
And you're his? I help manage his affairs.
- He's an important person.
- So is she.
I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.
The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset.
We've both done rather well, you and I.
Yes.
Given where we started.
And where is that? It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out.
Watch out for her.
I always do.
Watch out for her with him.
They're growing fast.
Not fast enough.
I can't wait that long.
I need an army.
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.
Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.
The distinction means a good deal to some people.
Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne? It's too beautiful a day to argue.
You're right.
Another lovely day on the high seas.
Don't mock them.
They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship.
They followed me across the poison water.
If they'll do it, others will.
And with a true khalasar-- The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi.
You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.
And not before.
Your Grace.
I heard you were dead.
Not yet.
I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.
We are alone.
Your Grace, you are the rightful king.
Not only by blood.
You're an honorable man, a just man.
And there is still a war to fight.
I am fighting.
By burning prisoners alive? How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos? I do not judge people for the gods they worship.
If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands.
I could have saved those men.
You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him.
But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind.
Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
Don't despair, Ser Davos.
What I told your son is true.
Death by fire is the purest death.
This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
- Your Grace! - Come on.
You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
- She will destroy us all! - I will pray for you.
Your Grace! Halt.
Down.
Halt.
Down.
Why have we stopped? It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.
What is she doing? Who gave her permission? My lady.
We should have guards, my lady.
Why? Pardon me.
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.
I have others.
Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace? No.
He was a soldier.
He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.
He never came back.
And your mother? She died when she had me.
Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.
Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.
He wasn't a knight.
He was just a soldier.
And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good.
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.
Was your father a soldier, too? You should be proud, too.
Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city.
They saved us all.
From now on, we're going to take care of you.
All of you.
Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them.
Directly to me.
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.
Please, sit.
Sit.
I do apologize, my lady.
Small council meetings.
At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time? That's a lovely gown, my lady.
Yes, it suits you perfectly.
I imagine you might be rather cold.
The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady? I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.
Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm.
- Doesn't it, Loras? - Yes.
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.
I've never seen anything like it.
You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen.
Perhaps before.
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
Yes.
I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear.
Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.
We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.
The king barely escaped with his life.
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
Our lives were never truly in danger.
You're right, of course.
But you are your father's son.
We can't all have a king's bravery.
Hunger turns men into beasts.
I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.
They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.
Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.
And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before.
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
I'm sure she does.
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
They will stand until they drop.
Such is their obedience.
They may suit my needs.
Tell me of their training.
_ _ _ _ _ _ They begin their training at five.
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.
Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.
They fear nothing.
Even the bravest men fear death.
_ _ _ _ My master says the Unsullied are not men.
Death means nothing to them.
_ _ He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
Tell the good master there is no need.
_ _ _ My master points out that men don't need nipples.
_ _ To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.
This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? _ _ _ My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.
How many do you have to sell? _ Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.
Many other buyers are interested.
The Unsullied are a means to an end.
Once I own them, these men-- They're not men.
Not anymore.
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you? You'll be fair to them.
You won't mutilate them to make a point.
You won't order them to murder babies.
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.
A great injustice has been done to them.
Closing your eyes will not undo it.
The warlocks.
I owe you my life, ser.
The honor is mine, my queen.
You know this man? I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
King Robert is dead.
I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.
I was sworn to protect your family.
I failed them.
I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.
Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.
Got it!

Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
I saw what took it.
When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
How did you kill those guards? Show me how.
If you would learn, you must come with me.
I want to, but I need to find my brother and mother.
And my sister.
You have to go.
Go to the Wall, to Jon.
Osha, you must protect them.
You're the only one who can.
slaughtered like sheep.
The debt will be repaid, my friend.
For them and for your sons.
They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
Those were Stark men.
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do.
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom this morning.
I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there.
The king barely escaped with his life.
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
You said you'd take me home.
If you were to tell just one Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do.
- Tell me when.
- Watch out for her.
Watch out for her with him.
Ah! We need to get back to the Wall.
We know what's out there, but we have to warn them.
Don't think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
And which one of you was a marksman at 10? Father? You can't kill it, you know.
Why not? Because the raven is you.
Hodor.
It's all right, Hodor.
Hodor.
Were you inside the wolf again, little lord? No, it was the three-eyed raven.
He's back.
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.
- There was a boy.
- I don't want to hear about it.
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.
We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
I know you didn't, little lord.
We need to move.
We don't know who might be after us.
No one even knows we're alive.
And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you? - No.
- Some good he is, then.
I don't know what other people know and what they don't.
I only know the Wall is a long way off.
My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.
Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.
Did you ever think you'd marry one? I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
Never? Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.
Pardon me, Your Grace.
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.
Let me guess which one is the good news.
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
I hadn't seen him in years.
I don't even know how many.
We'll travel to the funeral together.
Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest? Something else? By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.
They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.
They may have escaped.
Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.
Have you received any demands? No.
Have you heard anything from Theon at all? Where am I? Who are you? What do you want? I want to do this.
Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests? Yes.
So how shall we pass the time? By putting one foot in front of the other.
It's going to be a very dull walk.
I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.
Dull is fine.
You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.
Trust me on this.
People have been serving me since I was born.
You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.
If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know.
She's an honest woman.
All the good it's done her.
How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
Not your concern, Kingslayer.
It had to be recently.
You weren't with her at Winterfell.
How would you know? Because I visited Winterfell.
I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
Move.
- Were you pledged to Stannis? - Gods, no.
Ah, Renly.
Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.
- Shut your mouth.
- Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget.
Could hardly escape the little tulip.
Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.
I knew him far better than you.
I knew him as well as anyone.
As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.
He would have been a wonderful king.
Sounds like you quite fancied him.
I did not fancy him.
Oh, gods, you did.
Did you ever tell him? No, of course not.
You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.
He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell.
You're far too much man for him.
I'm not interested in foul rumors.
Unless they're about me.
It's all true about Renly.
His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.
It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth! I don't blame him.
And I don't blame you, either.
We don't get to choose who we love.
- Where are you headed, then? - South.
- You? - Riverrun.
Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go.
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.
Looks like you're safe enough, though.
Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you.
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.
He knows who I am.
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.
But what if you're not? What if he tells someone? We're not doing it.
He's an innocent man.
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters? Make it tighter here.
That's better.
It makes you look very strong.
No flowers.
I said no flowers.
All these are wrong.
Bring others.
Yes, Your Grace.
Bloody flowers.
On the king.
Looks like a Tyrell rose.
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.
Should be more than enough fabric.
Tell me what you think of her.
Who? Margaery.
She's an ideal match.
With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners.
Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.
Yes, she is.
Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
Not to me.
I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself-- This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.
She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.
That's what intelligent women do-- what they're told.
- You need to ask yourself-- - I don't need to do anything.
Better.
Much better.
I still don't believe it.
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.
He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
Littlefinger's not in love with me.
Love is not the thing he wants.
He's too old.
They never see it that way.
He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or? No.
If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.
Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
Send him in.
Lady Sansa.
Ser Loras.
My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens.
May I escort you to them? I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.
You are too kind, Ser Loras.
You probably don't remember the first time we met.
At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.
A rose, a red rose.
Of course I did.
It's more your color.
- You take it.
- Thank you.
You're such a dear.
I'll take my leave.
Lady Sansa.
Thank you, Ser Loras.
Come.
Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
Kiss me, child.
It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.
We're very sorry for your losses.
And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.
And charming and very clean.
He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.
Father liked him and so did Loras.
Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick.
That does not make him wise.
As to your fathead father-- Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us? She might think we have some wits about us.
One of us, at any rate.
It was treason.
I warned them.
Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.
How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.
But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders.
So here we are to see things through.
What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes? Lemon cake's my favorite.
So we've been told.
Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me.
I'm much less boring than these others.
Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden? I haven't had the pleasure.
No great pleasure, believe me.
A ponderous oaf.
His father was an oaf as well.
My husband, the late Lord Luthor.
He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.
They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.
And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse.
Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.
I I You, you.
Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales.
Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue? Joff-- King Joffrey, he-- His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.
But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.
Bring me some cheese.
The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.
The cheese will be served when I want it served.
And I want it served now.
Are you frightened, child? No need for that.
We're only women here.
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.
My father always told the truth.
Yes, he had that reputation.
And they named him traitor and took his head.
Joffrey.
Joffrey did that.
He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off.
And he said that was mercy.
Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
Go on.
I-- I can't.
I never meant-- my father was a traitor.
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.
Please don't make me say anymore.
She's terrified, Grandmother.
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.
We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.
He's a monster.
Ah.
That's a pity.
Please, don't stop the wedding.
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen.
Even so, we thank you for the truth.
Ah, here comes my cheese.
We're at war.
This march is a distraction.
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.
Then it's a distraction.
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
We need his men.
Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.
Have you lost faith in our cause? If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.
If you no longer believe-- I can believe till it snows in Dorne.
Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
You don't think we can win? May I speak my mind, Your Grace? Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark? I think you lost this war the day you married her.
Whoa, whoa.
Your Grace.
You're afraid of her.
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.
May I help you, Lady Stark? No.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-- You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them.
Only a mother can make them.
You've made them before? Twice.
Did they work? After a fashion.
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.
Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.
But it would be a very long night.
So I sat with him all through the darkness.
Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.
Which boy? Jon Snow.
When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.
I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me.
So I prayed to the gods, take him away.
Make him die.
He got the pox.
And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.
A murderer.
I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother.
A woman he didn't even know.
So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live.
Let him live and I'll love him.
I'll be a mother to him.
I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.
And he lived.
And he lived.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand? Yes.
You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you.
I've got wildling blood in my veins.
- These are my people.
- I understand.
Well, how could you understand? You want to protect your people.
Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army.
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.
The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.
Everyone hates the cave people.
So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army? No.
I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south.
Because that's the truth.
Shouldn't be long now.
What's wrong with him? He's a warg.
He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
He's scouting for us.
What, you've never met a warg? Orell.
Where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men.
What did you see? Dead crows.
What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering.
That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.
Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.
Hey.
Get up, Sam.
- No.
- Get up.
I can't.
If you stop, you'll die.
'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.
You left me.
When the white walkers came, you left me.
Aye, we left you.
You're fat and you're slow.
We didn't want to die.
Help me get him up.
Looks like that piggy is done for.
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.
Just get him up! Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
What is this? Get up, Tarly.
- Is he all right? - Aye, I think so.
If he can't, we may as well just go without him.
That's enough.
Tarly, I forbid you to die.
Do you hear me? - Why should the rest of us-- - Rast you're responsible for him.
What am I supposed to do? Make sure he gets back alive.
If he doesn't, you don't.
Move on! I'm not dying for you, Piggy.
You hear me? Where's Rickon and Hodor? Looking for food.
What's out there? Not another step, boy.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.
I'm unarmed.
That was poor planning.
My sister carries the weapons.
I'm better with them.
Drop the spear.
Drop it.
If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.
You must be Summer.
I'm Jojen Reed.
This is my sister Meera.
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.
And we have much farther to go.
I'm just trying to understand.
Would you please shut up about it? Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.
He offered to kill any three people you wanted.
Dead.
All you had to do was give him the names.
Anyone.
You could have picked King Joffrey.
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining? But you could have ended the war.
- Where are we going? - North.
If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
Maybe we already passed it.
It's 100 feet wide.
How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun.
My mother grew up there.
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.
Could be a minstrel.
Shut up.
A lion still has claws A minstrel's got gold sometimes.
We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, - and buy some food.
- Shh.
And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains Weep o'er his hall With no one there to hear.
What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf? Just a dirty little cub, I think.
- Loose a few more shafts.
- Don't.
Put the sword down, girl.
You go on down the road.
Just keep on singing so we know where you are.
Leave us be and I won't kill you.
Generous.
You're a dangerous person.
I like dangerous people.
Why are your friends so shy? What friends? The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.
Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords.
You escape from Harrenhal? - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.
And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
No, who do you fight for? The Brotherhood without Banners.
Now come along.
I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for.
They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
You've got nothing to fear from us, son.
The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
We're trying to save it.
Now come on.
We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew.
And then you can go on your way.
Here's the thing, fat boy.
When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head.
So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.
Half the country's starving and look at this one.
Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
My lion.
We've spoken of this.
You cannot come here.
But you said I should come to you with any problems.
Did anyone see you? - No.
- You sure? My father does not make idle threats.
Having you killed would be the high point of his week.
You have to be absolutely certain.
All right.
What is this problem? I'm worried about Sansa.
When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.
Baelish doesn't have friends.
I don't know her name.
- Oh, Ros? The redhead? - How do you know her? I try to know as many people as I can.
You never know which one you'll need.
She's a whore.
Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.
All right, yes, I fucked her once.
Twice.
But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.
And was she good? Did you like her? Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now.
What did she say about Littlefinger? That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We have to protect her.
We can't.
Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors.
A great beauty with a very old name.
A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty? Yes, she is, objectively, very.
Her face is quite pleasing-- to other men and to women, people in general.
But not to me, of course.
I only have eyes for you.
You pervert.
You want her? - This child? - I don't even want to talk about her.
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.
I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.
"Oh, the cruelty.
Shae is so cruel to me.
" Hmm, yes.
Now do you think I'm cruel? Only if you stop.
But you mustn't come here again.
Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people.
Dangerous people.
Lady Tyrell, my king.
Send her in.
You wanted to see me, Your Grace? I'm leaving on a hunting trip.
I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.
I have everything I could want.
Good.
Good.
How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
A welcome one.
A military encampment is no place for a lady.
And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady? Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.
What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it? The duty of any wife to any husband-- to provide him with children.
You failed to do this.
- Why? - I-- I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.
You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart? No.
I do beg your pardon.
The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.
Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
What makes you say this? Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-- he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils.
He never wanted to try.
Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-- something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children.
Maybe the fault was with me.
No, he was a known degenerate.
It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.
Mmm.
I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
As is your right.
You must do whatever you need to do.
You are the king.
Yes.
I am.
Do you like it? I just had it made.
Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
It's beautiful.
Will you show me how it works? It's a new design.
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.
You use this lever to draw the string.
The bolt goes here.
And then you just aim and Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.
It's not unheard of.
My father would never let me before-- You no longer belong to him.
Do you want to hold it? May I? Please.
I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
Could you do it? Could you kill something? I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could? Yes.
Would you like to watch me? Yes.
Stop! Stop! - Tell us the truth.
- About what? I don't know what you want.
I want the truth.
What truth? Why'd you take Winterfell? I took it to-- I took it-- - Who gave the orders? - No one.
- I took it on my own.
- Why? To take the North while it was vulnerable.
What were you going to do once you took it? Hold it.
Rule it.
Good.
That's very good.
Why did you do that? I told you.
Why did you take Winterfell? I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the Starks.
I hated them for holding me prisoner.
I wanted to hurt them.
What are you doing? Please.
I'll tell you anything.
Just take it off.
Please.
Please, just take it off.
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
No, don't go.
Please, please.
No, please don't leave me.
Please, please.
Please, please don't go! Please.
Please.
Don't leave me.
Please don't go.
Rickon, stay with us.
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.
You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.
Only when I'm asleep.
That's how it begins until you learn to control it.
You're a warg.
It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a-- - A three-eyed raven? - You've seen it? We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten? Does it have anything to do with warging? No, the raven is something different, something deeper.
The raven brings the sight.
Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
What's he telling him? Why don't you ask? Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him? Where's the shame in that? Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
Some people will always need help.
That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
When my father died, I dreamt it.
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.
So did I.
You have the sight, too? When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.
Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did.
But I saw that, too.
What else have you seen? Only one thing that matters-- you.
I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.
Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.
I don't drink ale.
There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
- Yeah! - You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.
It's very tedious for all concerned.
Now, how did three children-- We're not children.
How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal? Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.
A smith, eh? Where'd you train? King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.
That criminal.
He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
That's because he's twice as good.
Aha! A smith and a salesman.
Gendry stole us weapons.
Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
My brothers taught me.
Ooh! To your brothers! You can finish your meals before you go.
It may be awhile before you see another.
- You'll free us? - I gave you my word.
But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-- Hey, hey.
Now that is an uncommonly large person.
How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person? One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.
Aha, not a man at all.
A Hound! So good to see you again, Clegane.
Thoros? The fuck you doing here? Drinking and talking too much.
Same as ever.
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Yeah! Girl.
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? It's a tough decision-- take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.
Good luck.
It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.
Which will she choose? Gambler at heart.
Wouldn't have guessed.
Be quick about it.
- I need to rest.
- Get up.
I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far.
- What do you call them? - Get up now.
Corns.
I never used to get corns.
Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
This heel is ruined.
There's no way-- I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
Ooh.
You move well for a great beast of a woman.
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.
It gives away the game.
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.
But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.
You're good.
Graceless, but good.
See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.
Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets our juices flowing.
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.
A bit gruesome for my taste.
- You sure he's the one? - That's him, all right.
I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.
Give the man his silver.
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.
I'd rather he takes yours.
This march is a distraction.
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.
Then it's a distraction.
- They're growing fast.
- Not fast enough.
I need an army.
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.
Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.
- Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.
- Who do you fight for? - The Brotherhood without Banners.
The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
We're trying to save it.
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.
I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.
I will not fail you again.
- What's wrong with him? - He's a warg.
He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
He's scouting for us.
Orell, where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men.
- What did you see? - Dead crows.
Get up, Tarly.
I forbid you to die.
You're responsible for him.
Make sure he gets back alive.
So good to see you again, Clegane.
Girl.
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? Get up.
Ah! Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
Enough to buy me a new head? If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-- Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him "nephew.
" He is your king.
Robb knows I meant him no disr-- You're lucky I'm not your king.
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.
I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles.
No, there's glory enough to go around.
It's not about glory.
Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
I seized an opportunity.
What value was the mill? The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
Is he there now? Of course not.
We took the fight to him.
He could not withstand us.
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him.
I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.
I could have that head on a spike by now.
Instead, I have a mill.
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
Martyn is 15, I believe.
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
Have I sued for peace? No.
Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons? No.
How many men did you lose? But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-- We need our men more than Tywin needs his! I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- You would have.
Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
We seem to be running short of patience here.
You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
Intimate.
Lovely table.
Better chairs than the old small council chamber.
Conveniently close to your own quarters.
I like it.
What news of Jaime? have known about his escape for weeks.
Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.
Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is? - We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.
What do we have, then? Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.
In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, - in practice if not in name.
- Well, let him have it.
The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.
Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.
She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
Titles do seem to breed titles.
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems.
The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.
Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.
Fully agreed.
Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
Master of Coin? It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
Hear, hear.
He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear and the maiden fair I hope you're pleased.
If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.
You were armed when we were taken.
I was in chains if you recall.
Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
All my life I've been hearing, "Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.
" You were slower than I expected.
And more predictable.
I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.
You were not beating me.
Maybe you were as good as people said once.
Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.
More than once.
None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.
You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I? - They'll knock your teeth out.
You think I care about my teeth? No, I don't think you care about your teeth.
If you fight them, they will kill you.
Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you.
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter? - What does it matter? - Close your eyes.
Pretend they're Renly.
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted? If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.
But I'm not, thank the gods.
If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.
Doesn't have to look pretty.
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady.
- What am I? - Our guest.
No one's put any chains on you.
So I can walk away, then? These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
You're lucky we found you.
You think you're good with that bow, you little twat? Better than anyone you've ever met.
A coward's weapon.
I like to fight up close.
I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
Why? So you can kiss him? You remember the last time you were here? Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.
Watch your head.
Off we go.
Walk up! What are you doing? We're about to leave.
I'm staying.
You're what? I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better.
Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him.
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.
My brother ain't no king.
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.
Winterfell.
- You sure? - I'm sure.
Well, I made you something.
What is it? It's a wolf.
Yes, it is.
That's the tail? Yeah.
Well, be safe.
Yeah, you, too.
Don't get stabbed.
You don't burn your fingers.
Good-bye, Hot Pie.
Good-bye, Arry.
Up you go, little lady.
Hey, Hot Pie.
It's really good.
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
I've missed you, Uncle.
Father missed you, too, from the day you left.
Maybe he never said it in so many words-- Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox.
I was surprised when he died.
Didn't think death had the patience.
I'm glad you were with him.
I wish to the gods I had been.
Did you make peace in the end? After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it.
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.
He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.
I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.
Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off.
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.
"Wait for me and I'll come back to you.
" And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.
I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return.
I will never see them again.
You mustn't think it.
We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.
Robb believes they're alive.
And he must go on believing.
He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.
And you must remain strong for him.
You're Robb Stark's wife.
Hold still.
Is it true what they say about him? I don't know.
What do they say about him? That he can turn into a wolf at night.
True.
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
True.
You're a Lannister, aren't you? Martyn Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.
Unless it's a full moon.
It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.
Always the artists.
It's only horses.
No men.
You said there was dead crows.
There was.
How many men were here? About 300.
And you know what those men are now? We're all the same to them-- meat for their army.
Do you think anyone got away? It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.
But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.
And he lost.
His best fighting men are dead.
And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home.
Tormund.
Climb the Wall.
Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.
He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us.
And if he's useful, good.
If not throw him off the Wall.
See if crows can fly.
We're finally going to war, old friend? Hide near Castle Black.
When I give the signal, hit them in the night.
They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.
- If you do your job.
- Ah.
How will we see your signal? Send your eagle above the Wall every night.
When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
Ghost? What have we here? Frozen crows? We've come a long way.
Smaller flock than you went north with.
We can talk inside.
Oh, can we? They need some water.
Tether it and I'll be inside.
Keep your eyes where they belong.
They're not for you.
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
Aye, pig's got value to me.
You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.
I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.
You are a godly man? I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.
When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you.
The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods.
The real gods.
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.
Women.
That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.
Barely a grunt.
And she's almost as fat as this one here.
Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go.
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.
Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya? I see the head.
Push.
That's it.
You're nearly there.
One more push should do it.
What is it? What is it? Keep quiet.
If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.
I can ride.
You're sure? Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.
Your sister's waiting for you.
I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
We're not in the Iron Islands.
- Go.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on back.
You refuse to tell me where you're going? I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.
- How long will you be gone? - I don't know.
You're abandoning me.
I will never abandon you.
You are the Son of Fire.
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.
When I return, you will understand.
My enemies think they've destroyed me.
They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me.
I want Joffrey dead.
I want Robb Stark dead.
Make me another son.
I cannot.
Why? You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.
I want you.
Your fires burn low, my king.
There is another way.
A better way.
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.
You are.
But there are others with your blood in their veins.
You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.
The Lord of Light demands it.
The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
- To whom? - To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
Give me your water.
Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
Here, drink.
Leave this place, Your Grace.
Leave tonight, I beg you.
And what is she to do for soldiers? We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.
That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.
The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan? - Three.
- Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands? I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.
You know what I saw? Butchery.
Babies, children, old men.
More women raped than you can count.
There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.
But the Unsullied are not men.
They do not rape.
They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so.
If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction.
I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace.
I bled beside him.
Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.
All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace? They did not.
I want to buy them all.
_ _ _ _ There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all? Yes.
8,000.
And the ones still in training as well.
_ _ Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys.
If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
I will have them all or take none.
Many will fall in battle.
I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
_ Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
_ Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
The gold you have left is worth 10.
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.
The Dothraki you have with you-- _ The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
_ Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining I have dragons.
I'll give you one.
You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
Khaleesi, please.
Three dragons.
- One.
- Two.
One.
They want the biggest one.
- Done.
- Done.
I'll take you as well, now.
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.
A token of a bargain well struck.
_ _ Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
Aegon Targaryen proved that.
You're both here to advise me.
I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else.
Is that understood? Do you have a name? This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.
Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? No, Your Grace.
No family living.
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment.
Do you know what he said to me? "Let me die.
" There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? All questions have been taken from them.
They obey, that is all.
Once they are yours, they are yours.
They will fall on their swords if you command it.
And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.
You may go hungry.
You may fall sick.
You may be killed.
Valar morghulis.
Yes, all men must die.
But we are not men.
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
I'm surprised you're surprised.
This is the safest place in the city.
Not for bastards.
That's all of them, my lord.
Thank you, my dear.
Pod.
Pod.
Take them outside.
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.
You should have him knighted.
If only the Master of Coin had such power.
If only.
I owe you a significant debt.
Our redheaded friend.
You secured her release when the queen detained her.
Oh, that.
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.
Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
We don't.
I did fuck her once.
- I know.
- But we don't.
I know.
But how would the queen get that idea? Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? Keep a low profile.
If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.
Well, you are richer than I am.
Good point.
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.
Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.
I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do.
Enjoy the Eyrie.
Come on, I'm here later.
Come on.
Tonight, then.
Looks like dull reading.
You think all reading is dull reading.
It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
Unless he made it all up, yes.
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord? After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.
Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman? - No, my lord.
- Wonderful.
Genna specializes in first-timers.
She's not bad with second-timers, either.
Uh, my lord A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself.
She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
He's handsome.
You didn't tell me he was handsome.
Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.
One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
My lord, I don't even She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as "my lord.
" Be back in time for my supper.
Pace yourself, lad.
For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.
Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.
No.
- He's stealing it? - Worse, he's borrowing it.
What's wrong with that? We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.
The crown owes millions to my father.
Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.
Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.
I've never borrowed money before.
I'm not clear on the rules.
Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
And what if I don't? Well, you have to.
But what if I don't? This is why I don't lend you money.
Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.
We owe them tens of millions.
If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.
One way or another, they always get their gold back.
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.
Does he have a little jaunt in his step? The lad's practically skipping.
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.
Or should I say my money's worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.
Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.
They wouldn't take it, my lord.
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything.
- What did you do to them? - Lots of things.
And they seemed to like these things? Yes, my lord.
Of course they seemed to like it.
They're paid to seem to like it.
Only they weren't paid.
What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free? Is that what you're telling us? Sit down, Podrick.
We're going to need details.
Copious details.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
Ha! Ha! You know how we deal with runaways here, do you? Take off his pants.
No! No! No, no, no! I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
No, please! No, no, no! No, don't! No, please! No! No! You little bastard.
Come, my lord.
You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
I'll take the big bitch first.
When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
Nobody said shit about you.
You're only making it worse.
Take her over there where it's dark.
I'd like a little privacy.
Come on! You know who she is, don't you? A big dumb bitch from who cares where.
Never been with a woman that big.
She's Brienne of Tarth.
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.
Heard of Tarth? I'm gonna cut your throat! They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.
Sapphires are gemstones.
- The blue ones.
- I know what they are.
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him.
But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.
Bring her back here.
Yes, my lord.
- Get up.
- Come on.
Come on, on your feet.
Unbesmirched.
Not defiled.
Fancy word for a fancy man.
I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse.
Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.
I learned a lot of fancy words.
I bet you did.
Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back? You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.
And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them.
Lands, titles-- you'll have them all.
The North can't win this war.
You're a smart man.
You understand that.
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.
Aye, you have both.
Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.
Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
Hard to argue with that.
Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree.
I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it.
I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.
None of us are.
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
Come on, men.
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
I'm famished, actually.
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
Well, I do like partridge.
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.
Will this work as a table, my lord? Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic-- ah! On the stump.
You think you're the smartest man there is.
That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
- My father-- - And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say "my father" and that's it, all your troubles are gone.
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say? Careful.
You don't want to say the wrong thing.
You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here.
Never forget that.
Here, this should help you remember.

Jaime has his hand cut.

END CREDITS
INT. KING'S LANDING

The camera pans up to the hold of a sword hewn from Valeryan steel. Tywin draws it and hands it to a blacksmith, who knocks its hilt off with a hammer, and then places the blade into the forge. It melts into molten sludge and is then recast into two swords. Tywin throws the carcass of a wolf into the fire.

INT. Jaime holds up a sword, admiring it.

JAIME: Magnificent.

TYWIN:  Mm-hmm.

JAIME: Looks fresh-forged.

TYWIN: It is.

JAIME: No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.

TYWIN: There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.

JAIME: Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

TYWIN: From someone who no longer had need of it.

JAIME nods and hefts the blade.

JAIME: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.

TYWIN: And now we have two.

JAIME: Two?

TYWIN: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.

JAIME: Well, thank you. It's glorious.

JAIME attempts to sheath the sword into the cover lying on the table, but fails awkwardly. TYWIN starts as the sheath bobbles.

TYWIN: You'll have to train your left hand.

JAIME: Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.

TYWIN: You'll never be as good.

JAIME: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.

TYWIN: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.

JAIME: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.

TYWIN:  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.

JAIME: How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?

TYWIN:  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.

JAIME: Home?

TYWIN: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.

JAIME:You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

TYWIN:  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.

JAIME: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.

TYWIN:  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.

JAIME: No.

TYWIN:  No?

JIAME: No.

TYWIN: I don't believe I asked you a question.

JAIME: There's my answer.

TYWIN:  If you think your bloody honor comes before...

JAIME: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.

TYWIN:  What do you want?

JAIME: Supper would be nice.

TYWIN: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

JAIME: I suppose you want the sword back.

TYWIN:  Keep it.

JAIME grabs the sword.

TYWIN: A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.

JAIME picks up the sword and exits

EXT. Outside King's Landing

TYRION, PODRICK and BRONN stand on a road leading to King's Landing. BRONN holds a sigil with both stag and lion. Commoners dot the road in their daily routine. A peasant leads two reluctant, bleating goats past them.

BRONN: How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?

TYRION: Please don't.

BRONN: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.

TYRION: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.

BRONN: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?

TYRION: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.

BRONN: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?

TYRION: No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

BRONN: Oh.

Hoofbeats approach.

TYRION: Ah, here we are.

TYRION claps.

TYRION: Can you read the sigils?

BRONN: Yellow balls?

PODRICK: Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

TYRION: Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

BRONN: I need a sigil.

TYRION:  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?

PODRICK: I don't see it, my lord.

TYRION nods and steps foward to greet th first Dornish lords that approach on horsebak.

TYRION: Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

DORNISH LORD: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.

TYRION: (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.

DORNISH LORD: Will he?

TYRION: And where is Prince Oberyn?

DORNISH LORD: Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.

TYRION: Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.

The Dornish lords advance rudely, before TYRION can finish his welcome.

TYRION: You must be weary after such a long journey.

TYRION, BRONN and PODRICK must step aside to make way. PODRICK struggles with his sigil. They begin walking back to the city.

BRONN: Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?

TYRION:  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.

BRONN: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?

TYRION: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?

BRONN: I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.

CUT TO: INTERIOR, brothel

OBERYN walks behind a row of prostitutes, taking their measure. He comes around to face them, walking past OLYVAR. ELLARIA lounges behind him, as he decides upon WHORE #1.

OBERYN: Look at this one. How lovely is she?

ELLARIA: Beautiful. But pale.

OBERYN: They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.

OBERYN removes her tunic.  Do I frighten you?

WHORE #1: (Shakes her head no, looking down. )

OBERYN: You like?

ELLARIA: Timid. Timid bores me.

OBERYN moves to WHORE #2, the next in line. She has been meeting the gaze of the Dornish visitors.

OBERYN: You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

WHORE #1, scuttles shyly to dress herself.

OBERYN: I think she likes you. ELLARIA" She has good taste.

OBERYN: You're not timid, are you?

WHORE #2 saunters forward, smirking, and acrobatically balances on her left foot while pulling her right foot behind her to touch her head.

ELLARIA: (Laughs) Not timid.

OBERYN:  Do you like women?

WHORE #2: When they look like her, my lord.

ELLARIA: This one will do nicely.

OLYVAR: Very good, my lady.

ELLARIA: Oh, I'm not a lady.

OLYVAR: A term of courtesy in this establishment.

ELLARIA: A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.

OLYVAR: Any of the others?

OBERYN:  The two girls can leave.

OLYVAR snaps his fingers and turns to leave.

OBERYN:  You stay.

OLYVAR: I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.

OBERYN:  Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.

OLYVAR:  My lord.

OBERYN:  I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?

OLYVAR: Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.

OBERYN:  Take off your clothes.

OBERYN, opens OLYVAR"s tunic and caresses him. Meanwhile ELLARIA and WHORE #2 are kissing and fondling one another.

OLYVAR: Which way do you like it?

OBERYN roughly grabs OLYVAR's cock.

OLYVAR: (Gasps)

OBERYN: My way  .

MORGAN: And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere.  And now the rains

OBERYN is perturbed by the singing.

ELLARIA: Oberyn.

MORGAN:  Weep o'er his hall...

OBERYN moves towards the source of the singing.

ELLARIA:  Oberyn, don't.

ELLARIA gets up and hands her wine to WHORE #2 and follows OBERYN, concerned.

CUT TO: A nearby room in the brothel.

MORGAN and MORGAN'S FRIEND sit entangled with their prostitutes. One of them is singing.

MORGAN:   With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains  weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear.

OBERYN enters.

MORGAN'S FRIEND: You lost, friend?

OBERYN: Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.

MORGAN'S FRIEND: I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.

OBERYN: We don't like the smell. (Laughs)

ELLARIA grabs OBERYN to persuade him to leave. OLYVAR enters behind them.

ELLARIA: Come with me, lover.

MORGAN: Gods, look at this one.

OLYVAR: Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.

MORGAN: Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. (Laughs)

OBERYN: Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?

OBERYN walks towards the men. MORGAN and MORGAN"S FRIEND rise to his challenge, and their whores flee the room.

OBERYN: You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.

MORGAN grabs towards his weapon on the table, but OBERYN is faster. He pierces MORGAN's hand with his dagger, and traps it against the table.

MORGAN: (Screams)

MORGAN'S FRIEND grabs the hilt of his blade and begins to draw.

OBERYN: Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.

OBERYN twists the blade

MORGAN: (Groans)

OBERYN: He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.

MORGAN'S FRIEND ponders while MORGAN groans and OBERYN smiles devilishly.

TYRION and BRONN enter swiftly.

TYRION: Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...

MORGAN'S FRIEND pops his sword back and OBERYN flicks his dagger free from the table, and MORGAN's hand. MORGAN lets out a cry of anguish and then he and his friend move away quickly.

TYRION: trouble.

ELLARIA moves to OBERYN, and caresses him.

OBERYN: Apologies, my love.

MORGAN'S FRIEND helps MORGAN though the door to exit. OBERYN and ELLARIA kiss passionately. TYRION and BRONN exchange a puzzled look.

TYRION: I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

Reluctantly, OBERYN and ELLARIA release their embrace.

OBERYN: Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

TYRION: If there's anything I can do to make your stay...

OBERYN: What are you? His hired killer?

BRONN: It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

OBERYN: How did that come to pass?

BRONN: Killed the right people, I suppose.

OBERYN laughs. BRONN joins him.

OBERYN: We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

Comically, BRONN nods while TYRION shakes his head.  OBERYN. You don't partake?

TYRION: Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

ELLARIA continues to kiss OBERYN.

TYRION: Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?

ELLARIA releases her embrace and OBERYN signals for her to go.

EXT. Outside of the brothel.

The door opens and TYRION and OBERYN emerge.

OBERYN: Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.

TYRION: Oh, they take all kinds.

OBERYN: Even Dornishmen.

TYRION: The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.

OBERYN: Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.

TYRION: Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.

OBERYN: (Chuckles)

TYRION: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

OBERYN: I was invited to the royal wedding.

TYRION: I thought we were speaking truth.

OBERYN: The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...

TYRION: I wasn't actually present.

OBERYN: And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?

TYRION's gaze is cast downward, so OBERYN takes his chin and meets his eyes.

OBERYN: I'm asking you a question.

TYRION: I've heard rumors.

OBERYN: (Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.

TYRION: I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

OBERYN: If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

OBERYN exits and TYRION looks concerned.

EXT. ESSOS

DAENERYS sits with DROGON nuzzling her, while VISERION and RHAEGAL fly in the distance. DAENERYS chuckles and strokes DROGON, soothing him. JORAH walks up. VISERION and RHAEGAL tussle in midair over a carcass, which lands before the rock where DAENERYS sits. The two dragons follow, fighting to claim the meat. DROGON rises to his haunches, and roars. The other dragons submit and DROGON moves to take the carcass. JORAH comes closer.

JORAH: They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.

CUT TO: ESSOS EXTERIOR

The unsullied stand at the ready. DAENERYS and JORAH approach, followed by three Dothraki. They walk up tot join BARRISTAN SELMY and MISSANDEI in front of the troops.

DAENERYS: Ser Barristan.

BARRISTAN: Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?

BARRISTAN: Gambling, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Gambling?

Annoyed, DAENERYS strides forward. MISSANDEI follows briskly. They walk between rows and rows of unsullied.

CUT TO: ESSOS village exterior.

The crowd bows in reverence as DAENERYS and MISSANDEI stride past.

CROWD: Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...

DAENERYS: How long have they been at it?

MISSANDEI: Since midnight, Your Grace.

They come upon DAARIO NAHARIS and GREY WORM, who sit cross legged facing one another. Each of them holds their arms extended straight before them,  their weapons resting atop. Apparently, this is a game of endurance.

DAARIO: Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

DAENERYS: What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?

DAARIO: The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.

DENERYS: That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.

DAENERYS turns to leave, but neither of the men budge.

DAENERYS: The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.

DAARIO and GREY WORM drop their arms simultaneously. Their weapons fall to the sand. DAARIO groans, while MISSANDEI gives GREY WORM a look. DARIO nods to GREY WORM and they both stand.

DAARIO: (in valerian) You like this girl? Must be frustrating.

GREY WORM: (in valerian) You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.

DAARIO: (in valerian) I'd rather have no brains and two balls.

DAARIO leaves, and GREY WORM watches, stretching his aching shoulders.

EXT. King's Landing.

MAREI stands in the background while. SHAE fills a plate from a garden banquet table, and places it before SANSA, who sits motionless.

SHAE: You need to eat something.

SANSA does not respond.

SHAE: Pigeon pie.

SANSA: No, thank you.

SHAE looks back to the table for other options, and picks up SANSA's plate.

SHAE: Lemon cakes?

SANSA: No, thank you.

SHAE: You love lemon cakes.

TYRION enters.

SHAE: Tell her she needs to eat.

TYRION: My lady, you do need to eat.

SANSA: I don't need to eat.

TYRION: If I could have a moment alone with my wife.

MAREI leaves, but SHAE stays. TYRION nodes, imploringly.

SHAE: She needs to eat.

SHAE exits and TYRION sits at the table with SANSA. He takes her hand.

TYRION: I can't let you starve.

SHAE looks back in anger.

TYRION: I swore to protect you.

SANSA looks away and removes her hand from Tyrion's.

TYRION: My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.

SANSA: How can you help me?

TYRION: I don't know, but I can try.

SANSA: I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.

TYRION: I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.

SANSA: Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.

TYRION: What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.

SANSA stands, and TYRION does as well, in politeness.

SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.

TYRION: Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

SANSA: I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.

SANSA exits and TYRION watches her go.

INT. TYRION's chambers.

Tyrion enters, and shuts the door. Shae lies in his bed.

SHAE: My lion.

TYRION: What are you doing?

SHAE: What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.

TYRION: How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.

SHAE: I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?

TYRION: Of course I haven't forgotten.

SHAE: I want you. Don't you want me?

TYRION:  Things are a bit tense right now.

SHAE: What things?

TYRION: My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.

SHAE: You need to relax.

SHAE takes TYRION's fingers into her mouth to moisten them, then places his hand under her dress.

SHAE: Don't you want to relax?

SHAE tries to kiss him, but TYRION removes his hand in defiance.

SHAE:  What's wrong?

TYRION: I told you. It's not a good time.

SHAE:  It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.

TYRION:  Shae.

SHAE: Do you love her?

TYRION:  Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.

SHAE:  That's not an answer.

TYRION: Of course I don't love her.

SHAE: You tried to ship me away.

TYRION: Ship you away?

SHAE: Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

TYRION:  What in the world are you talking about?

SHAE: If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!

TYRION:  Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.

SHAE: You want me to stay?

TYRION does not respond. SHAE picks up her shoe and leaves in anger. MAREI is eavesdropping behind a column.

INT. King's Landing.

QYBURN places a sleeve over the stump of JAIME's wrist. He then grabs a golden hand and pushes it onto Jaime's stump, twisting it into place. JAIME groans and grimaces.

JAIME: (Groans)

QYBURN: A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.

CERSEI pours wine in the foreground.

JAIME: You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.

CERSEI: Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.

JAIME: Days?

CERSEI: Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?

JAIME moves his metal hand around for effect.

JAIME: Uh... a hook would be more practical.

CERSEI: Elegant, I think.

QYBURN squeeze the hand firmly into place, and JAIME winces. QYBURN starts to depart but CERSEI intercepts him.

CERSIE: Thank you for your help with the other matter.

QYBURN: The symptoms have abated?

CERSEI: Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

QYBURN: Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.

QYBURN turns to JAIME, who waves his fake hand meekly. QYBURN gives CERSEI one last look, and exits.

JAIME: Odd little man.

CERSEI:  I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?

JAIME: What symptoms?

CERSEI: Symptoms that are not your concern.

JAIME: You let him touch you?

CERSEI: You jealous?

JAIME: I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.

CERSEI: (Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.

JAIME: I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

CERSEI: Well, they smell like Pycelle.

JAIME: You drink more than you used to.

CERSEI: Yes.

JAIME: Why?

CERSEI: Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.

JAIME: It must have been traumatic for you.

CERSEI: My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.

JAIME: A rather short siege.

CERSEI: A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...

JAIME sits beside her.

JAIME: Father disowned me today.

CERSEI: He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

JAIME: You're forgetting Tyrion.

CERSEI: You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?

JAIME takes her hand.

JAIME: Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

He moves to kiss her.

CERSEI: Not now.

JAIME:  I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

CERSEI does not answer.

JAIME: Something's changed.

CERSEI: Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?

JAIME: What do you want me to apologize for?

CERSEI: For leaving me.

JAIME: You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

CERSEI: Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.

JAIME: Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.

CERSEI: You took too long.

JAIME:  I... What are you saying?

CERSEI:  I'm saying you took too long.

There is a knocking at the door.

CERSEI: Come in.

JAIME: Go away.

MAREI enters.

MAREI: Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important.

EXT. North of the wall.

YGRITTE sits fletching arrows. TORMUND approaches.

TORMUND: You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

YGRITTE: Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?

TORMUND: We wait for Mance's orders.

YGRITTE: You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

TORMUND: And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.

YGRITTE: Yeah, well, he's a liar.

TORMUND: He is? Shouldn't it be "he was"? You said you put three arrows in him.

YGRITTE:  I did.

TORMUND: I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.

A wildling whistles from above. TORMUND and YGRITTE turn to look, and rise.

CUT TO: The crevice

YGRITTE and TORMUND lead a group of wildlings with weapons draw. Other wildings stand above the crevice where they advance.  Some Thenns approach, led by the menacing STYR.

TORMUND: Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.

TORMUND sheathes his sword. The Thenns come closer.

TORMUND: Mance sent you?

STYR:  (Grunts)

The Thenn party continues to walk through

TORMUND: How did you find us?

STYR nods back at a THENN WARG, who releases a bird for reconnaisance.

TORMUND: You came from the south, not the north.

WARG: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.

A Thenn drops a heavy bag from his shoulder to the floor of the crevice.

STYR: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?

TORMUND: Help yourself.

STYR: (Chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.

The Thenns pull some bird meat off the spit that was on the fire.

STYR: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?

STYR pats TORMUND on the shoulder as he walks past. TORMUND follows, with YGRITTE further behind.

STYR: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?

TORMUND: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.

STYR: She yours?

YGRITTE: I'm not anybody's.

YGRITTE notches an arrow and places it directly on  STYR's throat. Two of his Thenn companions draw their swords.  STYR stares YGRITTE down.

STYR: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.

STYR turns his attention to TORMUND. YGRITTE lowers her bow a TORMUND's command. The other Thenns continue to work at the fire.

STYR: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

STYR walks towards the fire.

STYR: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.

STYR kneels before the fire, where the other Thenns have skewered a human arm on the spit roasting in the fire.

EXT. Winterfell. Some Knight's Watch recruits are practicing their archery.

OFFICER: Draw. Loose.

SAM walks by the recruits as they fire their arrows at a row of straw men, to varying effect. He then walks up the steps to JON's quarters.

CUT TO: Jon's quarters

Jon is dressing in pain. SAM stands behind him.

JON: Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. "He said, " Next time I see you, you'll be all in black." I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

SAM: Sometimes I want to hate you.

JON turns in surprise.

SAM: Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.

JON: (Chuckles)

SAM: They're... they're ready for you.

JON picks up his leather armor and walks towards the door.

JON: He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.

SAM: No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.

JON: I've done plenty wrong.

INT. Winterfell.

ALLISER THORNE questions JON SNOW. He is flanked by JANOS SLYNT and MAESTRE AEMON

ALLISER THORNE: So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

JON: I didn't murder him.

ALLISER THORNE:  No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?

JON: He wanted me to kill him.

JANOS SLYNT: A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?

JON: The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

ALLISER THORNE: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.

JON: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...

JANOS SLYNT: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.

JON: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.

JANOS SLYNT: You admit to breaking your vows, then?

JON: I do.

JANOS SLYNT: The law is the law. The boy must die.

MAESTER AEMON: If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.

ALLISER THORNE: There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.

JON: While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.

ALLISER THORNE:  Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.

JON: 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.

JANOS SLYNT: (Laughs) Giants?

JON: Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

JANOS SLUNT: I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.

JON: And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.

JANOS SLYNT stands in indignation.

JANOS SLYNT: How dare you?!

JON: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.

JANOS SLYNT sits back down.

JON: Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

MAESTER AEMON: None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on.

JON nods and leaves. MAESTER AEMON stands to leave, frail and helped by his assistant. He moves slowly down the wooden stairs from the dais to the floor.

ALLISER THORNE: I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

MAESTER AEMON: Yes, you are.

ALLISER THORNE:  And I don't trust the bastard.

MAESTER AEMON: He told the truth.

ALLISER THORNE: And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?

MAESTER AEMON: I grew up in King's Landing.

EXT. King's Landing garden.

OLENNA and MARGAERY consider necklace options for her wedding.

OLENNA: No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.

OLENNA picks up one of the necklaces, sentimentally. MARGAERY smiles.

OLENNA: Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.

OLENNA tosses the necklace away, surprising MARGAERY.

MARGAERY: The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.

OLENNA: Nonsense.

OLENNA turns to the half dozen maids waiting.

OLENNA: My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.

The maids exit, laughing. OLENNA turns back to MARGAERY. They sit.

OLENNA: The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.

MARGAERY: Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

OLENNA: You watch that. Even here, even with me.

Footsteps approach and BRIENNE enters.

OLENNA: My word.

BRIENNE: My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.

OLENNA: We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.

BRIENNE looks embarrassed.

OLENNA: I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.

BRIENNE: My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.

OLENNA turns to MARGAERY, intrigued.

OLENNA: You dare not refuse.

CUT TO: Another part of the garden.

BRIENNE and MARGAERY stroll next to a pond

MARGAERY: A shadow?

BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.

MARGAERY: Joffrey is our king now.

BRIENNE: I meant no offense.

MARGAERY: And you've given none.

MARGAERY gently touches BRIENNE on the shoulder.

INT. King's Landing.

JOFFREY, JAIME and Endrew Tarth are strategizing.

JAIME: All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?

JOFFREY: Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on.

JAIME: Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.

ENDREW: I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence.

JAIME: And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

ENDREW: The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.

JAIME: Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

JOFFREY: By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.

JAIME: The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

JOFFREY: I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

JAIME: My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.

JOFFREY: Busy getting captured.

JOFFREY thumbs through a large tome.

JAIME: So this is the famous "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.

JAIME: So they say.

JOFFREY: Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)

There is very little written in the Book of Brothers about JAIME.

JOFFREY: Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.

JAIME:  There's still time.

JOFFREY:  Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?

JAIME: I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.

JOFFREY and ENDREW exit. JAIME walks over to the book, and slams it shut.

EXT. ESSOS

The unsullied are marching past DAENERYS and MISSANDEI, who stand on a cliff overlooking the shore.

DAENERYS: Have you ever been to Meereen?

MISSANDEI: Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.

DAENERYS: And?

MISSANDEI: They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

DAENERYS: And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?

MISSANDEI:  If they're smart, Your Grace.

Footsteps approach, and DAARIO NAHARIS enters.

DSAENERYS: You were told to ride at the back of the train.

DAARIO: Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.

DAENERYS signals for MISSANDEI to leave them.

MISSANDEI: Your Grace.

MISSANDEI exists.

DAENERYS: All right, what is this matter of strategy?

DAARIO presents DAENERYS with a purple flower.

DAARIO: A dusk rose.

DAENERYS: Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?

DAENERYS starts to walk away, but DAARIO follows and presents her with another small flowering plant, this one is white.

DAARIO: And this one's called lady's lace.

DAENERYS: Would you like to walk without shoes?

DAAERIO: You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy.

DAARIO presents her with a red flower.

DAARIO: Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.

DAARIO presents the three flowers to DAENERYS in a small bouquet.

DAENERYS: You are a gambler, aren't you?

She takes the flowers. DAARIO makes a small bow to depart.

DAARIO: Your Grace.

DAENERYS ponders. A man shouts in valerian. She joins, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH, GREY WORM and MISSANDEI. They have found a mile marker, festooned by a woman's corpse who points the way to Mereen.s

JORAH: There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.

DAENERYS: How many miles are there between here and Meereen?

BARRISTAN: 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.

DAENERYS: You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.

EXT.  KING'S LANDING.

SANSA stands on the shore with eyes closed. BRIENNE and JAIME stand on the cliff above.

BRIENNE: There she is.

JAIME: Yes, there she is.

BRIENNE: And? You made a promise.

JAIME: To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.

BRIENNE: To keep them safe.

JAIME: Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.

BRIENNE: A complication does not release you from a vow.

JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?

BRIENNE: Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

JAIME: Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.

JAIME exits. BRIENNE follows.

SANSA comes up from the shore. She hears something, and realizes that she is not alone. She quickens her pace through the woods. A man trails her, stealthily. She speeds her walk, and comes to a table. TOMMY taps her on the shoulder. She starts.

SER DONTOS:  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

SANSA:  You're drunk.

SER DONTOS: Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?

SANSA: Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

SER DONTOS: I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

SANSA: Anyone would have done the same.

SER DONTOS: But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life.

SER DONTOS gives SANSA a necklace with blue stones. SANSA looks closely at it.

SER DONTOS: It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

SANSA: I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.

SER DONTOS: I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.

SANSA: I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

SER DONTOS: Yeah.

They both smile

EXT. THE RIVERLANDS

ARYA sits in front of the HOUND on his horse. They ride through a scene of brutal violence, with villagers slaughtered amongst their upended carts. Flies buzz at the corpses.

ARYA: When am I going to get a horse of my own?

HOUND: The little lady wants a pony.

ARYA: The little lady wants away from your stench.

HOUND: Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?

ARYA: Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?

HOUND: No.

ARYA: You're not very smart, are you?

HOUND: I'm not a thief.

ARYA: You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?

HOUND: A man's got to have a code.

ARYA: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.

HOUND: You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.

CUT TO: outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings.

ARYA: I'm hungry. You're hungry.

HOUND: Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.

Two men exit the bulding, and ARYA recognizes POLLIVER.

ARYA: I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.

The two men urinate into the bushes by the farm.

ARYA: He killed Lommy.

HOUND: What the fuck's a Lommy?

ARYA: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.

HOUND: Got what?

ARYA: My sword Needle.

HOUND:  Needle? Of course you named your sword.

ARYA: Lots of people name their swords.

HOUND: Lots of cunts.

The two men finish relieving themselves and return inside. The HOUND notices that ARYA has started towards the Inn.

HOUND: What are you... get back here.

ARYA: My brother gave me that sword.

HOUND:  Get back here.

ARYA:  He killed my friend.

The HOUND grabs ARYA roughly by the should and puts himself between her and the door.

HOUND: I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.

The door opens behind him and a soldier meets his eye. The HOUND turns to face him fully. He retreats, allowing the HOUND to enter.

CUT TO: FARMHOUSE INTERIOR

The HOUND enters the door, and a woman can be heard whimpering while the soldiers egg each other on.

MAN: Come on, give it up.

INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)

MAN: Come here.

INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)

MAN: Let's have a feel there.

MAN #2: Leave it.

The INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER struggles in the grasp of one of the men ARYA enters behind the hound and shuts the door. The soldiers look warily at their the duo. Everyone goes quiet as the HOUND and ARYA enter the inn. The HOUND and ARYA sit at a table in the back. The men return to their assault on the girl.

MAN: Come here.

INNKEEPER: Please, she's a good girl.

POLLIVER: Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.

POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA . He recognizes her.

POLLIVER: I know you.

ARYA graps the hilt of the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER stnads.

POLLIVER: You're the Hound.

ARYA is relieved. She releases her grip on the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER walks over and joins their table.

POLLIVER: Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?

HOUND: I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?

POLLIVER: Just keeping the king's peace.

HOUND: No need. The war's over.

The INNKEEPER pours them some ale. The HOUND drinks.

POLLIVER: So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.

HOUND: None taken.

POLLIVER: He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)

POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA.

POLLIVER: But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

HOUND: She's all right. I've had better.

POLLIVER: (Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.

HOUND: I'm not going to King's Landing.

POLLIVER: Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.

HOUND: Fuck the king.

The chatter in the inn stops.The HOUND takes a drink.

POLLIVER: When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are.

HOUND: Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.

POLLIVER: You got money to pay for it?

HOUND: You paid for it?

POLLIVER: (Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?

HOUND: Not a penny.

HOUND: I'll still take that chicken.

POLLIVER: Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

The men chuckle.

HOUND: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.

The HOUND takes POLLIVER's ale, and finishes it in one long drink.

HOUND: Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.

POLLIVER: You don't seem to understand the situation.

HOUND: I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.

POLLIVER: You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?

HOUND: Someone is.

The men stare one another down. POLLIVER rises to attack, but the HOUND turns over the table, knocking him down. He then sets to the room and dispatches the soldiers one by one, while the INNKEEPER cowers. The fight is brutal, using both sword and fist. POLLIVER and a companion. are able to get the upper hand, and the HOUND falls to the ground, where they kick at him violently. ARYA watches in fright. The HOUND manages to fend them off with his sword, even from the ground. He sweeps the legs out from under one of them, and POLLIVER scambles on all fours towards his sword. The HOUND steps on the blade and slugs POLLIVER violently, who crumples to the ground. The fight continues, and the HOUND gores another soldier before TOMMY pins the HOUND to the ground, a dagger to his throat. With great strength, the HOUND pulls the man's dagger away from his throat while gouging at his face. He positions the man's face over his own dagger, and swiftly slams the soldier's face into the dagger, repeatedly.

ARYA moves from shock into action. She shatters a jug over a soldier's head, then picks up a sword and stabs him through, slowly. She comes up behind POLLIVER, who is stalking the wounded HOUND, and stabs him through. She takes need from him before he falls forward to the ground. The HOUND runs another soldier through. ARYA walks calmly over POLLIVER, who lays on his back.

ARYA: Something wrong with your leg, boy?

POLLIVER: What? What do you mean?

ARYA: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

POLLIVER: Carry me?

ARYA: Fine little blade.

ARYA puts the point of her blade under POLLIVER's chin. He raises his hands weakly in surrender.

ARYA: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

A light of recognition fills POLLIVER's eyes, met quickly by ARYA stabbing him through the chin, slowly. He gasps and gurgles. She removes her sword and watches the blood fill his mouth. He chokes, spurts, and dies.

EXT. Outside the inn

The HOUND rides his mount, chewing on some chicken. ARYA comes into view behind him on her own white horse. She looks pleased. They ride through the devastation of the countryside.
EXT: Woods.

Dogs bark and a woman laughs. Another woman breathes in panic, gasping for breath

Ramsay: Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!

RAMSAY and MYRANDA run together, holding hands. They each hold a bow as they run.  They are happy, excited and enjoying themselves. THEON limps behind them, trying to keep up. The hunting dogs continue to bark.

RAMSAY: Tansy! Tansy!

TANSY runs through the woods, the hunting dogs barking in pursuit. Further behind are RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON.

RAMSAY: There you are.  TANSAY; (screams)

MYRANDA: (laughing) I can't see her, Ramsay.

RAMSAY: Tansy!

RAMSAY notches an arrow. TANSY pauses at a tree, gasping for breath. RAMSAY's arrow strikes the tree, just inches from her face. She screams, and begins running again.

RAMSAY: If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!

MYRANDA expertly notches an arrow and lets it fly. It flies past TANSY, who stumbles down into a muddy stream, gasping and screaming. She scrambles on all fours in panic, pauses to hide in the shadowed stream bed. She sobs.

RAMSAY: Tansy.

MYRANDA: Where is she?

RAMSAY: Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!

The hunting dogs come barreling down the stream bed towards TANSY. She shrieks and whimpers, and starts running once again. The dogs chase her through a small tunnel and back into the woods proper. MYRANDA lets another arrow fly, with concentration and precision. It hits TANSY in the leg, and she falls, sobbing. The dogs terrorize her. RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON catch up.

RAMSAY: Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too.

MYRANDA:  I only wounded her.

RAMSAY:  You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?

THEON: A fine shot, master. My lady.

TANSY: Please, my lord. It hurts.

RAMSAY: Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon.

MYRANDA notches another arrow at takes aim.

MYRANDA: She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.

RAMSAY: We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work.

TANSY: Why? I did whatever you asked.

RAMSAY: But you made Myranda feel jealous.

MYRANDA lowers her bow, a bit taken aback.

MYRANDA:  Me jealous of her?

TANSY: My lord, please.

RAMSAY: You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.

RAMSAY turns from jaunty to ferocious.

RAMSAY: Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!

Off camera, the dogs tear into TANSY. She screams. THEON watches, dejected and powerless. Sounds of ripping flesh and TANSY screaming fill the woods.

RAMSAY: Not so pretty now.

TANSY's screams have stopped, but the sounds of ripping flesh continue. THEON struggles to hold back tears.

INT: King's Landing.

PODRICK serves sausages to TYRION. JAIME sits at the table, uncomfortably.

TYRION: Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

PODRICK: Is it solid gold?

JAIME: Gilded steel.

TYRION: You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.

JAIME: I'm not hungry.

TYRION: You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.

TYRION raises his cup.

TYRION: A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.

JAIME moves to raise his own cup, but knocks it over clumsily with is left hand.

JAIME:  Oh!

PODRICK: I'll clean it up.

JAIME: No, I'll do it. Leave us.

PODRICK exits, while JAIME places his cup right-side up.

TYRION: It's only wine.

He holds up his own cup and pours it out onto the table. JAIME sits back in resignation. TYRION stands and pours more wine.

JAIME: I can't fight anymore.

TYRION: What about your left?

JAIME: I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

TYRION: You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?

JAIME: I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...

TYRION: Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.

TYRION sits back down.

JAIME: With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.

TYRION: You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.

EXT: A rocky King's Landing shoreline.

BRONN appears, carrying some swords. He joins JAIME, who sits by the shore.

JAIME: My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.

BRONN: He tells me you shit gold just like your father.

JAIME: Is this place safe?

JAIME tosses a pouch of gold to BRONN.

BRONN: There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.

JAIME: Uh-huh.

BRONN: Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

BRONN pockets the gold. JAIME gets his sword, and spins it in his wrist to warm it. BRONN whistles in admiration.

BRONN: I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.

BRONN stands, holding two sparring swords.

BRONN: And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.

He drops one to the ground, clattering, and continues to walk forward.

JAIME: I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.

JAIME walks to the sparring sword, indignant. He reaches for it, but BRONN slaps his hand with his sword, just as he grabs it.

JAIME: Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.

BRONN: Best time to attack a man.

BRONN swings at JAIME, who parries clumsily. BRONN pushes him, and JAIME falters to the wall.

BRONN: Mind yourself. JAIME;  If I still had my right hand...

BRONN:  Plan on growing it back?

They engage in swordplay. JAIME parries defensively, but well. However, BRONN gets him off balance again and causes him to stumble with a forearm nudge. JAIME recovers and faces him. JAIME pants and resets.

JAIME: Come on, then.

JAIME makes an awkward attack, and they continue.

EXT: The Twins at night.

Some riders gallops down the Riverlands road,

MAN: Open the gates!

EXT: The Dreadfort courtyard

The men swing open the door and the riders enter.

MAN: Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!

RAMSAY stands to greet the riders. ROOSE BOLTON and WALDA dismount and approach.

RAMSAY: Father. Welcome home.

ROOSE: Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

RAMSEY steps forward to greet her, warmly smiling.

RAMSAY: A pleasure, Mother.

RAMSAY kisses her cheek. WALDA smiles awkwardly.

WALDA: Hello.

ROOSE: See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

WOMAN: This way, my lady.

WALDA and the WOMAN exit.

ROOSE: Where is your prize?

RAMSAY: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.

ROOSE exits, and RAMSAY greets LOCKE. They walk together

RAMSAY: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

LOCKE: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.

RAMSAY: (laughs)

CUT TO: Dreadfort interior.

ROOSE sits down by the fire, aching and exhausted from the ride. RAMSAY and THEON enter. A MAN stands in the background, sharpening a shaving razor against a strop.

RAMSAY: Father.

ROOSE rises to inspect THEON.

ROOSE: What did you do to him?

RAMSAY: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.

ROOSE: You flayed him.

RAMSAY: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.

ROOSE: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

RAMSAY: We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years. The flayed man is on our banners.

ROOSE: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

RAMSAY: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no...

ROOSE: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?

RAMSAY: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.

ROOSE: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.

RAMSAY: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us.

ROOSE: I placed far too much trust in you.

RAMSAY: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.

THEON:  I'm sorry, my lord.

RAMSAY:  Give him the razor.

RAMSAY sits.

RAMSAY: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?

THEON stakes the razor and the shaving cream.

RAMSAY: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.

THEON lathers RAMSAY's face and begins to shave it carefully.

RAMSAY: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

THEON: I don't know, my lord.

ROOSE: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

RAMSAY: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?

THEON: No, my lord. Just two farm boys.

RAMSAY: And crisped them so no one would know.

THEON: Yes, my lord.

RAMSAY: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.

THEON continues to shave RAMSAY and holds the razor on RAMSAY's throat. RAMSAY goads him.

RAMSAY: Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?

THEON's hand twitches, and he struggles with himself. Then he continues to shave RAMSAY slowly.

ROOSE: You ready for a hunt?

MERYN TRANT: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

ROOSE: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?

THEON: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

MERYN TRANT: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

ROOSE: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.

RAMSEY stands, cleanly shaven.

RAMSAY: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat.

ROOSE: You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.

EXT: King's Landing garden.

TYRION and PODRICK meet VARYS.

TYRION: Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?

VARYS: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.

TYRION: Oh, to be foreign.

VARYS: Ahem.

PODRICK stands aside as TYRION and VARYS head down a more secluded path.

VARYS: Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.

TYRION: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.

VARYS: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

TYRION:  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

VARYS: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.

TYRION: She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.

VARYS: Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?

VARYS bows and leaves. TYRION fumes.

EXT: A garden party.

SANSA, TYRION, JOFFREY, TYWIN, CERSEI, TOMMEN and PYCELLE sit at an outdoor banquet table. MACE TYRELL stands before them.

MACE: From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.

He places the up before JOFFREY.

MACE: May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.

JOFFREY: A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?

MACE: I shall be honored, Your Grace.

MACE bows and exits. SHAE brings a tray to the table and sets it before SANSA.

CERSEI: She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.

SHAE exits.

TYWIN: Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.

TYRION looks concerned. PODRICK places a large tome before JOFFREY and TYRION walks to the front of the table

JOFFREY: A book?

TYRION:  "The Lives of Four Kings." Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.

JOFFREY is at a loss for words. TYWIN entreats him to respond.

JOFFREY: Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.

TYRION bows. SHAE watches. The MOUNTAIN brings forth a sword and lays it on the table before JOFFREY. TYWIN stands.

TYWIN: One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.

Excitedly, JOFFREY walks around the table. Exuberantly, he unsheaths the sword.

PYCELLE: Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

JOFFREY: So they say.

JOFFREY steps away, then spins and cleaves the book that TYRION just gave him, repeatedly. People gasp in response. JOFFREY is very pleased.

JOFFREY: Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?

MAN: Stormbringer.

MAN #2: Terminus.

MAN #3: Widow's Wail.

MAN #4: Wolfsbane. -

JOFFREY: Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off. Ned Stark's head all over again.

JOFFREY sheaths the sword. SANSA looks dejected. He sits down next to MACE and SHAE continues to look on.

INT: TYRION's chambers

The door opens and SHAE walks in, smiling.

TYRION: Don't.

SHAE: You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?

TYRION: Don't call me that.

SHAE: What should I call you?

TYRION: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

SHAE: Our friendship?

TYRION: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.

SHAE: What? You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants.

SHAE: What is this?

TYRION: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.

SHAE: She doesn't want you.

TYRION:  I need to do right by her.

SHAE: You don't want her.

TYRION:  By our children.

SHAE: What are you afraid of?

TYRION:  I'm not afraid.

SHAE: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?  I need you to leave.

SHAE: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.

TYRION:  Shae.

SHAE: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.

TYRION: You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000?

SHAE: How many whores have you been with?

TYRION: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.

TYRION walks over and opens the door. SHAE sobs. BRONN enters.

TYRION: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.

SHAE continues to sob. BRONN clasps her shoulder to lead her out. She turns quickly and slaps him, then storms off, crying. BRONN looks to TYRION, then exits. TYRION walks to the table and violently slaps his cup to the ground.

EXT: Stannis's army camp in the  Stormlands at night.

A woman screams. A line of men are bound on top of unlit bonfires, including AXELL FLORENT. The soldiers mill about, carrying torches.

MELISANDRE: Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.

AXELL FLORENT: Sire, I served you well.

The crowd chants along with MELISANDRE

MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, show us the way...

AXELL FLORENT: Selyse, you're my sister!

SELYSE: (Chanting with the others) Yours are the stars that guide us.

AXELL FLORENT: Tell him! Tell him!

MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.

The bonfires ignite quickly. The men scream in agony and die.

SELYSE: (to STANNIS) Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?

STANNIS leaves without responding. DAVOS trails him.

DAVOS: Lord Florent was your brother by law. STANNIS; He was an infidel.

DAVOS: He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.

STANNIS: I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.

DAVOS: How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?

STANNIS: A good deal more than you.

STANNIS exits and SELYSE catches up, accompanied by MELISANDRE.

SELYSE: Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?

DAVOS: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.

MELISANDRE walks past DAVOS and he watches, silently.

INT: Storm's End Dining room

Stannis sits at table with SELYSE and MELISANDRE.

STANNIS: Meat's off.

SELYSE: Our larders are almost empty.

STANNIS: Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

SELYSE: You hate fish.

STANNIS: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.

SELYSE: (to MELISANDRE) When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?

STANNIS: Of course I remember.

SELYSE: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

MELISANDRE: It's all I knew when I was a child.

SELYSE: Until you found the Lord of Light?

MELISANDRE: Until he found me.

SELYSE: I fear for our daughter's soul.

MELISANDRE: Every mother should fear for her child's soul.

SELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.

STANNIS:  She's a child.

SELYSE: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.

STANNIS: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

SELYSE: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.

INT: SHIREEN's bedroom after dinner.

A knock on the door.

SHIREEN: Come in.

MELISANDRE enters.

MELISANDRE: Were you sleeping, Princess?

SHIREEN: (Shakes her head)

MELISANDRE:  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

SHIREEN: I heard it.

MELISANDRE: And it frightened you?

SHIREEN: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.

MELISANDRE: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.

SHIREEN: But they screamed.

MELISANDRE: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.

SHIREEN: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

MELISANDRE: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.

SHIREEN: And you didn't have this.

MELISANDRE: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?

SHIREEN: I read "The Seven-Pointed Star."

MELISANDRE sits next to SHIREEN to comfort her.

MELISANDRE: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.

SHIREEN: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?

MELISANDRE: There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.

EXT: The North at night.

Heavy breathing as the camera pans through the snowy woods. Suddenly, the camera lurches forward and comes upon a deer and the camera attacks viciously,  a wolf's hunt from the predator's point of view.  Hodor: Hodor.

CUT TO: Bran awakening. HODOR, MEERA and JOJEN are with him. BRAN is frantic and panting.

BRAN: Why did you wake me?

MEERA: You've been gone for hours.

BRAN: I was hungry.

MEERA: We're all hungry.

BRAN: I was just eating.

JOJEN: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran.

BRAN eats some morsels given to him by MEERA.

JOJEN: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.

MEERA: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything.

EXT: The North.

HODOR pulls BRAN through the woods on a sled. MEERA and JOJEN walk beside them. A wolf barks. They pause and BRAN turns to see his wolf, Summer.

BRAN: Hodor, take me to the tree.

HODOR carries BRAN to the base of the tree, sets him down and steps back. The bark seems to have twisted into a human face. BRAN touches it and launches into a vision of the Godswood, a THREE-EYED RAVEN, a sword, NED STARK's worried face, the Godswood again. Time speeds forward.

THREE-EYED RAVEN: Look for me... beneath the tree.

The THREE-EYED RAVEN lands on the branch of a Godswood. A storm of crows flies into a standing BRAN. A castle interior, an undead horse,

BRAN: He saw us.

BRAN falls from the Winterfell tower. A dragon's shadow sweeps over King's Landing.

THREE-EYED RAVEN: North.

BRAN gasps and releases his hand from the twisted face on the tree. The vision has ended. MEERA and JOJEN approach.

BRAN: I know where we have to go.

INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor.

MARGAERY and MACE walk down the aisle. MACE hands her to JOFFREY. The pair continue up the steps to the HIGH SEPTON. He places a cape over her shoulders. They clasp hands and they bar bound together.

HIGH SEPTON: Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.

JOFFREY: With this kiss, I pledge my love.

JOFFREY and MARGAERY kiss. The crowd applauds.

SANSA: We have a new queen.

TYRION: Better her than you.

EXT: King's Landing Garden.

TYWIN and OLENNA talk in the garden as the wedding guests filter out.

TYWIN: Bit much, wouldn't you say?

OLENNA:  It feels proportionate.

TYWIN:  Proportionate to what?

OLENNA: The expected extravagance.

TYWIN: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.

OLENNA: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.

MACE approaches and ties to join them.

OLENNA: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

TYWIN and OLENNA continue, while MACE rears back.

OLENNA: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.

TYWIN: Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?

OLENNA: No, your heartfelt thank-you is it's own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. "The Iron Bank will have it's due." How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.

TYWIN: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

OLENNA: We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

CUT TO; The wedding reception.

Jugglers and firebreathers, some on stilts, entertain the crowd. BRONN, TYRION and PODRICK walk among the tables.

BRONN: All taken care of.

TYRION: You saw her board the ship?

BRONN: Aye, she's on it.

TYRION: You saw the ship sail away?

BRONN: No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.

TYRION: How do you know?

BRONN: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.

TYRION: There's someone following you?

BRONN turns and clasps TYRION's shoulder.

BRONN: She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.

BRONN exits.

TYRION and PODRICK walk through the party. They encounter OBERYN and ELLARIA.

OBERYN: Hello.

TYRION: Hello.

OBERYN: Not you.

OBERYN and ELLARIA are enthralled by a contortionist. TYRION and PODRICK walk on.

CUT TO: The head table.

JOFFREY watches the party. OLENNA approaches SANSA.

OLENNA: You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.

TYRION enters and sits.

TYRION: My lady. My lady.

OLENNA: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.

MUSICIAN: A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine,  my lord...

MARGAERY is enjoying the performance, but JOFFREY is bored. He stands and throws some coins to them.

JOFFREY: Very good. Very good. Off you go.

The musicians scrabble to pick up the coins, and depart quickly. MARGAERY moves to calm JOFFREY. CERSEI watches jealously, TOMMEN at her side.  MARGAERY; My love, why don't we make the announcement?

JOFFREY stands and clanks his goblet for attention.

JOFFREY: Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.

The crowd applauds as JOFFREY sits and MARGAERY stands.

MARGAERY: We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.

The crowd applauds, and JOFFREY adores it. CERSEI comes over to MARGAERY.

CERSEI: You're an example to us all.

CERSEI kisses her on each cheek.

LORAS stands in the distance, and catches OBERYN's eye as he cuddles with ELLARIA. LORAS accidentally backs into JAIME.

LORAS: Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

JAIME: Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.

LORAS: As does yours.

JAIME: So, looking forward to your wedding?

LORAS: Yes, very much.

JAIME: Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.

LORAS: They certainly are.

JAIME: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.

LORAS: And neither will you.

LORAS pats JAIME on the shoulder, and exits. BRIENNE approaches the head table, and bows.

BRIENNE: Your Grace. My king. - My queen.

MARGAERY stands and shakes her hand.

MARGAERY:  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.

BRIENNE: I'm no lady, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Did you just bow?

BRIENNE: Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.

JOFFREY: You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.

MARGAERY: That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.

JOFFREY: A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.

BRIENNE:  I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

JOFFREY: Yes, yes.

MARGAERY: Thank you. I hope we see more of you.

BRIENNE departs, and the camera follows her. CERSEI intercepts her.

CERSEI: Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.

BRIENNE: As you say, Your Grace.

CERSEI: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.

BRIENNE: In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.

CERSEI: Did he? Haven't heard that story before.

BRIENNE:  Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.

CERSEI: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

BRIENNE: I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

CERSEI: But you love him.

BREINNE does not answer.

BRIENNE: Your Grace.

BRIENNE exits, and JAIME notices their conversation.

CUT TO; The head table.

PYCELLE has cornered a maid.

PYCELLE: No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.

CERSEI:  She'll do no such thing.

PYCELLE: Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice...

CERSEI: You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

MAID: Your Grace.

The MAID exits.

PYCELLE:  Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.

CERSEI: More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

PYCELLE: Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

CERSEI: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?

PYCELLE: I never meant to annoy anyone.

CERSEI: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.

PYCELLE: Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

CERSEI: The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.

PYCELLE exits, and CERSEI smiles.

CUT: the head table, where JOFFREY and MARGAERY watch a fool juggling. Once again, JOFFREY is not amused. He stands.

JOFFREY: A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

The fool is suddenly pelted with food, and he runs off. CERSEI and TYWIN enter.

TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.

CERSEI: I suppose I am.

TYWIN: I won't ask why.

CERSEI: Small pleasures.

OBERYN and ELLARIA enter.

OBERYN: Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

TYWIN: Prince Oberyn.

OBERYN: I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.

ELLARIA:  My lord. My lady.

TYWIN: Charmed.

CERSEI: Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

ELLARIA: We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

OBERYN: Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.

CERSEI: No? How tolerant of you.

OBERYN: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.

CERSEI: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.

TYWIN: Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.

OBERYN: They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.

TYWIN: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.

OBERYN: People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.

JOFFREY taps his goblet.

JOFFREY: Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...

A lever is pulled. A giant lion's mouth opens. A red carpet rolls down.

JOFFREY: I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.

Five dwarves come down from the lion's mouth, each dressed as one of the five kings. They run about,  playing their roles with comic glee. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY is very pleased. TYRION, less so.

RENLY DWARF: I'm the rightful king.

ROBB DWARF: King in the North!

JOFFREY DWARF: Yes!

BALON DWARF: Traitor. You're a traitor.

JOFFREY DWARF: For the Seven Kingdoms!

The dwarves line up on the stage.

JOFFREY DWARF: Let the war begin.

The crowd applauds. RENLY DWARF starts the prance about the stage.

STANNIS DWARF: Renly, you're no king.

BALON DWARF: Away, degenerate. Away. Away.

RENLY DWARF: Ooh, careful.

STANNIS DWARF:  Go on.

RENLY DWARF: I want you to be my prince. Stannis!

STANNIS DWARF and RENLY DWARF feign some indecent acts. LORAS leaves in disgust.

BALON DWARF: Who's got the gold now, Stark?

ROBB DWARF: I am the rightful king.

BALON DWARF: Challenge me, ruffian.

ROBB DWARF: Take that. -

BALON DWARF:  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

ROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North!

TYRION and SANSA are not amused.

JOFFREY DWARF shoots and arrow and hits STANNIS DWARF.

STANNIS DWARF: Not wildfire!

The crowd applauds. STANNIS DWARF runs off the stage, crying.

TYRON: Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

PODRICK: Yes, my lord.

TYRION: We'll have to find another way to thank the king.

JOFFREY is enjoying the spectacle, but MARGAERY is not.

JOFFREY DWARF and ROBB DWARF are having a stand off.

JOFFREY DWARF: Charge!

They run past one another without landing a blow.

JOFFREY DWARF: Ready, again.

ROBB DWARF:  I am the King in the North! - Charge!

JOFFREY DWARF: Charge! Yes!

This time, JOFFREY DWARD knocks off ROBB DWARF"s wolf helmet.

JOFFREY DWARF: Your head!

SANSA is mortified. JOFFREY laughs hysterically while MARGAERY looks at him, appalled.

ROBB DWARF falls. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY DWARF claims victory.

JOFFREY grabs his golbet.

JOFFREY DWARF feigns sodomizing the wolf head. SANSA is motionless. JOFFREY spits out his wine, laughing.

JOFFREY DWARF: Fine gentlemen.

The players take their bow and the crowd applauds. JOFFREY stands.

JOFFREY: Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.

The crowd laughs. Tyrion stands.

TYRION: One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.

TYRION sits, and JOFFREY is angered at his insults. The crowd quiets. JOFFREY walks over and pours his wine on TYRION's head. MARGAERY sits motionless.

TYRION: A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.

JOFFREY: It did not spill.

MARGAERY: My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.

JOFFREY: Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

TYRION: Your Grace does me a great honor.

JOFFREY: It's not meant as an honor.

TYRION stands and walks over to JOFFREY, who purposely drops his goblet. As TYRION tried to pick it up, he kicks it away.

JOFFREY:  Bring me my goblet.

TYRION kneels down to get the goblet. SANSA watches JOFFREY. She picks up the goblet and hands it to TYRION. He brings it to JOFFREY.

JOFFREY: What good is an empty cup? Fill it.

TYRION pours wine for JOFFREY in front of CERSEI, and hands it to him.

JOFFREY: Kneel. Kneel before your king.

TYRION does not budge.

JOFFREY: Kneel. I said... kneel!

MARGAERY: (Standing) Look, the pie.

The crowd applauds, and the attention turns to the giant pie carried in by four men.

JOFFREY: My queen.

JOFFREY strides forward, and hews the pie with his sword. To his surprise, doves are released from the pie. He looks triumphant.

MARGAERY: Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.

The pie is served to the guests.

SANSA:  Can we leave now?

TYRION:  Let's find out.

MARGAERY feeds a forkful of pie to JOFFREY.

JOFFREY: Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?

TYRION: I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

JOFFREY: No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine.

TYRION looks to SANSA.

JOFFREY: Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.

TYRION and fumes has he gets the goblet for JOFFREY. JOFFREY drinks deeply.

JOFFREY: Mm, good. Needs washing down.

TYRION: If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.

JOFFREY: No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un...

JOFFREY grabs his own throat, choking.

TYRION: Your Grace?

JOFFREY: It's nothing.

MARGAERY: He's choking!

OLENNA: Help the poor boy.

JOFFREY turns towards the crowd, choking and staggering.

OLENNA: Idiots, help your king. -

JAIME: Move away!

JAIME runs to JOFFREY, as he vomits.

JAIME: Joffrey! Joffrey!

CERSEI runs to them.

CERSEI:  Help him! Someone help him!

JOFFREY: (gags)

CERSEI: Joffrey!

SER DONTOS: (to SANSA) Come with me now.

CERSEI: Joffrey! Joffrey!

TYRION and MARGAERY watch, aghast. CERSEI and JAIME continue to try to help JOFFREY.

SER DONTOS: If you want to live, we have to leave.

CERSEI: Don't touch him!

JOFFREY gurgles and chokens. His face is turning purple, his eyes glazed, vomit lining his cheeks. He spasms.

CERSEI: Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!

Blood streams out of JOFFREY's nose. He convulses painfully. CERSEI cries as she watches him. He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him. JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple. He dies.

CERSEI: My son.

MAN: He's gone. Our king is gone.

CERSEI: He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!

Two guards grab TYRION. CERSEI looks upon the lifeless body of JOFFREY.
EXT. KING'S LANDING

The wedding banquet for Margaery and Joffrey has turned shocking and horrific. Joffrey lays dead in his mother's lap. Blood pours from his nose and vomit clings around his mouth. Cersei turns to Tyrion.

CERSEI: You did this. You did this!

Three guards grab Tyrion from behind. As Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her.

SER DONTOS: We have to leave.

CERSEI: Take him! Take him!

Tyrion is dragged off by guards as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush off through the crowd.

CERSEI: Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?

TYWIN: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.

CERSEI: Where is she?!

TYWIN: No one leaves the capital! No one!

EXT. KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK

A bell tolls as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush down to a small boat, separate from the Harbor.

SER DONTOS: Get in.

SANSA: Where are we going?

SER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.

Sansa and Ser Dontos sail out into the ocean, far from King's Landing.

EXT. MISTY OCEAN AT NIGHT

They come across a huge mysterious ship in the middle of the misty sea. Ser Dontos pulls his smaller boat up alongside it.

SER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.

Sansa climbs the latter.

EXT. LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER

She climbs up a ladder on the side of the ship, as she reaches the top someone grabs her. She gasps before realizing who it is.

SANSA: Lord Baelish?

LITTLEFINGER: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?

SANSA: (shakes her head.)

LITTLEFINGER: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.

SER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.

LITTLEFINGER: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.

SER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?

SER DONTOS: 10,000.

Littlefinger clicks his finger and two men with crossbows walk to the edge of the ship. They aim at Ser Dontos.

SER DONTOS: Wait!

Both men shoot at Ser Dontos, he groans in pain before lying dead. Sansa screams and Littlefinger hushes her.

LITTLEFINGER: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?

SANSA: I didn't murder anyone.

LITTLEFINGER: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.

Sansa glances back to Ser Dontos' body.

SANSA: Why did you kill him?

LITTLEFINGER: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.

SANSA: He saved me.

LITTLEFINGER: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

SANSA: He was helping me because I saved his life.

LITTLEFINGER: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.

Littlefinger removes the necklace from around Sansa's neck and places it on the edge of the ship. He pull out a knife and hits one of the "crystals" and it smashes like glass. Sansa, confused, studies him.

LITTLEFINGER: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?

SANSA: We're all liars here.

Littlefinger pushes the necklace off the edge of the boat and it lands directly on Ser Dontos' lifeless body.

LITTLEFINGER: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.

CUT TO: EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY

Margaery Tyrell sits at the table with Olenna Tyrell.

MARGAERY: So am I the queen?

OLENNA: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.

MARGAERY: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.

OLENNA: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.

MARGAERY: What was it like?

OLENNA: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.

MARGAERY: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.

OLENNA: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.

MARGAERY: But I would have been the queen.

OLENNA: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.

CUT TO: INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY

Joffrey's body is laid on a table in the center on the room. Cersei, Tommen and Tywin and stand around him. Tywin turns to Tommen.

TYWIN: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?

Tommen stays quiet.

TYWIN: I'm not trying to trick you.

TOMMEN: It means I'll become king.

TYWIN: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?

TOMMEN: A good king?

TYWIN: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?

CERSEI: This is hardly the place or the time.

TOMMEN: Holiness?

TYWIN: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.

TOMMEN: Justice.

TYWIN: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?

TOMMEN: No.

TYWIN: No.

TOMMEN: What about strength?

TYWIN: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?

TOMMEN: Wisdom.

TYWIN: Yes!

TOMMEN: Wisdom is what makes a good king.

TYWIN: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?

TOMMEN: No.

TYWIN: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?

Tywin and Tommen begin walking up the steps to leave the Sept.

TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.

TYWIN: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?

TOMMEN: Yes.

TYWIN: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?

TOMMEN: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.

JAIME enters.

JAIME: How are you?

TOMMEN:  I'm all right.

JAIME:You are. You will be. I'll see to that.

TYWIN and TOMMEN exit.

JAIME: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.

HIGH SEPTON: Yes, my lord. All of you.

The High Septon snaps his fingers and the priests exit.

CERSEI: It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...

JAIME: I don't know what I saw.

CERSEI: Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.

JAIME: Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.

CERSEI: I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.

JAIME consoles CERSEI. They kiss. CERSEI steps back and gasps.

JAIME: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?

JAIME grabs CERSEI and forcefully kisses her. He presses against her.

CERSEI: Jaime, not here, please. Please.

JAIME rips at her dress. They end up tangled on the floor by the altar.

CERSEI: Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

JAIME: No.

CERSEI: Stop it. Stop.

She continues to resist, but her resolve is weakening. They kiss, and JAIME brings her to the ground and forces himself on her.

CERSEI: Stop.  Stop. It's not right.

JAIME: (GRUNTS)

CERSEI: It's not right. It's not right.

JAIME:  I don't care.

CERSEI: (CRYING)  Don't.

JAIME: I don't care.

CERSEI: Don't. Jaime, don't.

JAIME: I don't care.

EXT: RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT

Thunder rumbles as the HOUND relieves himself and ARYA plucks the leaves from a plant.

ARYA: Gonna rain soon. Where are we?

HOUND: Near Fairmarket, I think.

ARYA: You think? You don't have a map?

HOUND: No, I don't have a map.

ARYA: Maybe we should get one.

HOUND: Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.

ARYA: How far is it to the Eyrie?

HOUND: Far.

ARYA: And you're sure we're going the right way?

The HOUND feed his mount some water.

HOUND: Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.

ARYA: On your way where?

HOUND:  Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.

ARYA: I'd like to see Braavos one day.

HOUND: Why Braavos?

ARYA: I have friends there.

HOUND:  I doubt it.

FARMER HAMLET: Seven blessings to you.

FARMER HAMLET and SALLY sit in their wagon above them.

HOUND:  What do you want?

FARMER HAMLET: What do I want? This is my land.

HOUND:  If I'm standing on it, it's my land.

ARYA: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.

FARMER HAMLET: (nods)

ARYA: He's never been the same.

FARMER HAMLET: Which house did he fight for?

ARYA: The Tullys of Riverrun.

FARMER HAMLET: There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.

CUT TO: FARMER'S HOME.

Thunder rumbles and the rain patters. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY host ARYA and the HOUND for dinner.

FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.

HOUND: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?

ARYA: Father!

FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.

HOUND: And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.

The HOUND impatiently grabs the pot and pours himself some soup.

ARYA: I'm so sorry.

The HOUND and ARYA slurp hungrily. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY watch, a bit appalled at their manners.

ARYA: Really good.

FARMER HAMLET: Did you fight at the Twins?

HOUND: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.

FARMER HAMLET: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.

HOUND: Guest right don't mean much anymore.

FARMER HAMLET: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.

HOUND: You got any ale?

FARMER HAMLET:  Afraid not.

HOUND: How can a man not keep ale in his home?

FARMER HAMLET:  You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.

HOUND: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?

HOUND: (Nods) Fair wages for fair work.

INT. BARN - EARLY MORNING

Chickens cluck as ARYA sleeps in the hay. Faint voices argue. A punch lands, a man groans and a girl screams.

EXT: BARN

ARYA leaves the barn and strides towards the HOUND, FARMER HAMLET and SALLY. The farmer lies on the ground and SALLY tends him. The HOUND has taken something and is walking away.

ARYA: What did you do?!

HOUND:  Get your horse saddled.

ARYA: You told me you weren't a thief.

HOUND: I wasn't.

ARYA: He took us in. He fed us and you...

HOUND: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.

ARYA: You don't know that.

HOUND: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.

ARYA: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.

HOUND: There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?

EXT- CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD

Two rangers walk through the courtyard, taking account of the new recruits.

RANGER: Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.

SAM passes them and encounters ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT at the stairwell.

ALLISER THORNE: There he is, Sam the Slayer.

JANOS SLYNT: Going to visit your wildling whore?

SAM: She's not a whore.

JANOS SLYNT: No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.

INT.: CASTLE BLACK

GILLY lets SAM into the room.

SAM: They all think I'm lying.

GILLY: About what?

SAM: Killing the white Walker.

GILLY:  You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.

GILLY touches LITTLE SAM.

SAM: But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...

GILLY:  A what?

SAM: Well, a wildling.

GILLY: My father hated that word.

SAM: It's not a very nice word, I suppose.

GILLY:  I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?

SAM sits next to her to help with the pluching.

SAM: So... are you all right? No one bothering you?

GILLY: I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.

SAM: I worry about it sometimes. All the time.

GILLY: Why do you worry about it?

SAM: 100 men, one woman.

GILLY: They've got other things to think about.

SAM: That's the only thing they think about.

GILLY: You're being silly.

SAM:  I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.

GILLY: What about you?

SAM: What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.

GILLY:  Thank you.

SAM: For what?

GILLY: For worrying about me.

SAM: I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.

GILLY: So what are you saying?

SAM: Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.

GILLY: Are you bored of me?

SAM: Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.

GILLY:  I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.

GILLY picks up the chickens and exits. SAM tends to LITTLE SAM.

INT. STORM'S END AT NIGHT

STANNIS stands looking at the storm. DAVOS enters.

DAVOS: Your Grace.

STANNIS: You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?

DAVOS picks up a scroll and struggles to read it.

DAVOS: Joffrey?

STANNIS: The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.

DAVOS: I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...

STANNIS: What progress have you made?

While DAVOS names houses, STANNIS picks up pieces from the war table, snaps them and discards them.

DAVOS: I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.

STANNIS: House Peasebury.

DAVOS: House Musgood.

STANNIS:  House Musgood.

DAVOS: And House Haigh.

STANNIS: House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.

DAVOS: Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.

STANNIS:  The Golden Company?

DAVOS: They've never broken a contract.

STANNIS: They're sellswords.

DAVOS: We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.

STANNIS: We don't have any gold.

DAVOS: Not yet.

STANNIS:  If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -

INT Storm's End, SHIREEN's room.

DAVOS knocks and enters.

SHIREEN: You're late.

DAVOS: I'm sorry, Princess.

SHIREEN: I thought you weren't coming.

DAVOS: The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.

SHIREEN: You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

DAVOS: That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.

SHIREEN: It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.

DAVOS sits and takes up a book to practice reading.

SHIREEN:  You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.

DAVOS: "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."

SHIREEN claps.

DAVOS: Thank you very much.

SHIREEN: I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.

DAVOS: No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.

SHIREEN: What's the difference?

DAVOS: Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.

SHIREEN: My father says a criminal is a criminal.

DAVOS: Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.

SHIREEN: You've sailed to Braavos?

DAVOS:  Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...

DAVOS has an inspired thought. He gets up, paces and then kisses SHIREEN on the forehead.

SHIREEN:  What was that for?

DAVOS:  I need you to write a message.

SHIREEN: You should write it yourself. It's good practice.

DAVOS: It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.

He hands her a quill and scroll. She begins to write.

DAVOS: To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.

SHIREEN: But that's not you.

DAVOS: I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.

SAM, GILLY and LITTLE SAM ride a cart through the busy town. LITTLE SAM coos.

SAM: He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?

INT. MOLE'S TOWN INN

SAM, GILLY and LITTLE SAM enter the tavern. A MOLE'S TOWN WHORE approaches GILLY while SAM talks to the MOLE'S TOWN MADAM.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Precious little thing.

GILLY: Thank you.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: What's his name?

GILLY: Sam.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Lovely. That the daddy?

GILLY: No.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Where's the daddy?

GILLY: He's dead.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Oh. Where you from?

GILLY: North of here.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: North of here? You a fucking wildling?

MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Only room and board?

SAM: That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.

MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Could find other work for her, too.

SAM: No other work.

MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.

SAM: No other work.

INT. MOLE'S TOWN BROTHEL BACK ROOM

SAM: I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?

GILLY: You protected me north of the Wall.

SAM: This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.

LITTLE SAM cries

SAM: You have to trust me. It's for the best.

GILLY puts LITTLE SAM down.

GILLY: Best for you.

SAM: Oh, Gilly. Please don't.

LITTLE SAM cries and GILLY tends him. SAM exits

INT. KING'S LANDING

ELLARIA, MAREI, a WHORE, OBERYN and OLYVAR  are engaged in passionate sex. ELLARIA turns her attention from MAREI to OLYVAR.

OBERYN: Greedy.

ELLARIA kissed OLYVAR deeply, but he does not return her ardor.

ELLARIA: No?

OLYVAR: I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.

OBERYN: You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?

ELLARIA: That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.

OBERYN: Your loss.

OBERYN takes a drink.

OLYVAR: You like them both the same? Boys and girls?

OLYVAR: Does that surprise you? Everyone has a preference. Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.

OLYVAR: I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.

OBERYN: What are you, 25?

ELLARIA: Children.

OBERYN:  (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.

OLYVAR: Did you?

ELLARIA: He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.

OBERYN: They will all have to line up behind you.

A door opens. TYWIN enters.

TYWIN:  Prince Oberyn.

OBERYN: Lord Tywin.

TYWIN: May we have the room?

ELLARIA: Call my name if you need me, lover.

OLYVAR, MAREI, the WHORE and ELLARIA exit

OBERYN: Would you like to sit?

TYWIN: No, thank you.

OBERYN: Some wine?

TYWIN: No, thank you.

OBERYN dresses and pours some wine.

OBERYN:  I'm sorry about your grandson.

TYWIN: Are you?

OBERYN: I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.

TYWIN: Which way is that?

OBERYN: Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?

TYWIN: Some believe the king choked.

OBERYN: Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.

TYWIN: I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.

OBERYN: I did. This is why I know.

TYWIN: Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning. Rather suspicious.

OBERYN: Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

TYWIN: You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?

OBERYN: You think we conspired together?

TYWIN: What did you discuss?

OBERYN: The death of my sister.

TYWIN: For which you blame me.

OBERYN: She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.

TYWIN: Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?

OBERYN: You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

TYWIN: Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.

OBERYN: So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

TYWIN: Categorically.

OBERYN: I would like to speak with the Mountain.

TYWIN: I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

OBERYN: He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.

TYWIN: I could arrange for this meeting.

OBERYN: But you want something in return.

TYWIN: There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.

OBERYN: Why?

TYWIN: Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.

OBERYN: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.

TYWIN: I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.

OBERYN: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

TYWIN: We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist. Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

OBERYN: You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.

TYWIN: We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.

OBERYN considers

INT. KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL

TYRION sits on the floor. The door unlocks and PODRICK enters.

TYRION: Podrick. Apologies for the stench.

PODRICK: I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.

TYRION: A noble effort.

PODRICK: They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.

TYRION: You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?

PODRICK: I've heard nothing, my lord.

TYRION: I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?

PODRICK: You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.

TYRION: Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?

PODRICK: No, my lord. You didn't?

TYRION: No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?

PODRICK: Your father.

TYRION: Of course.

PODRICK: Mace Tyrell.

TYRION: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.

PODRICK: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

TYRION: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.

PODRICK: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

TYRION: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.

PODRICK: My lord, she's gone.

TYRION: Gone?

PODRICK: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...

TYRION: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.

PODRICK: Yes, my lord?

TYRION: They'll be following you now.

PODRICK: Who will?

TYRION: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.

PODRICK: Any other witnesses, my lord?

TYRION: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

PODRICK: He's already been called as a witness for the queen.

TYRION: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.

PODRICK: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.

TYRION: Why not?

PODRICK: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.

TYRION: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

PODRICK: I'll ask, my lord.

PODRICK stands to go, but hesitates.

PODRICK: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.

TYRION: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

TYRION: Are you going to accept their offer?

PODRICK: My lord.

TYRION: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.

PODRICK: You've been good to me, my lord.

TYRION: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.

PODRICK: I already gave them an answer, my lord.

TYRION: I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.

PODRICK: My lord.

TYRION: Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.

PODRICK: Farewell, my lord.

PODRICK nods and opens the door.

TYRION: Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.

PODRICK bows his head as he exits.

EXT: THE NORTH

A bustling small village south of the wall. OLLY and GUYMON walk together

OLLY: Mother says it's time to eat.

GUYMON: What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

OLLY: Potatoes.

GUYMON: Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got...

An arrow whistles through the air and pierces OLLY'S FATHER's neck. He falls dead. YGRITTE is the archer, and she is resolute and angry.

MAN: The wildlings!

OLLY'S MOTHER notices that GUYMON has fallen. She runs to him and OLLY. She finds him lifeless.

OLLY'S MOTHER: Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!

OLLY runs as OLLY'S MOTHER cradles to body. The Thenns and wildlings attack, and she is hewn by the war axe of STYR. The Wildings take the village as OLLY runs for his life. TORMUND attacks brtutally with his sword. YGRITTE shoots down a villiager attacking him from behind. He falls, and TORMUND slits his throat. YGRITTE draws her sword and joins the melee

Meanwhile, OLLY hides under a wagon with some chickens. He watches YGRITTE, whimpering. Suddenly, he is pulled from behind, and a Thenn brings him to STYR.

STYR: You know how to get to Castle Black?

OLLY: Yes. Yes.

STYR puts OLLY over his shoulder and begins walking. He shows OLLY how the Thenns are butchering his parents.

STYR: Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.

STYR releases him, and OLLY runs.

INT. CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL

The rangers are gathered in the hall and YARWICK speaks. OLLY stands next to JON.

YARWYCK: We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.

MEN: Aye! Aye!

YARWYCK: Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.

MEN: Aye!

ALLISER THORNE: If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.

MAESTER AEMON: We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.

PYP: There's got to be a way to protect them.

ALLISER THORNE: You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?

JON: Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.

ALLISER THORNE: We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.

A horn blows. (HORN BLOWS)

PYP: Rangers returning.

INT. THE GATE TO THE WALL

The heavy gate is opening, showing winter beyond. JON, PYP and the rangers help DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN.

JON: Help him.

DOLOROUS EDD: Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

CUT TO: The courtyard.

JON helps DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN to the courtyard. ALLISER THORN and JANOS SLYNT walk up

ALLISER THORN: What took you so long?

GRENN: We were held up.

ALLISER THORN: By what?

GRENN: Chains.

DOLOROUS EDD: We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.

JON: And the mutineers stayed?

DOLOROUS EDD: They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.

JON: We need to ride north and kill them all.

ALLISER THORN: We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.

JON:  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.

PYP: I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

EXT: ESSOS

The unsullied march towards Meereen. DAENERYS, JORAH, SER BARRISTAN, MISSANDEI and DAARIO NAHARYS ride alongside. The riders dismount at the main gate while the unsullied stand at attention. The Meereen  citifolk watch from atop the walls.murmuring. The main door opens.

DAENERYS: Are they attacking?

JORAH: A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.

A single rider advances, and the crowd cheers. He halts horse to the side of DAENERYS's band. He dismounts.

CHAMPION:  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)

DAENERYS: What is he doing?

BARRISTAN SELMY: I believe he means to...

The CHAMPION urinates towards DAENERYS. The crowd laughs and cheers.

MISSANDEI: He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.

BARRISTAN SELMY: Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.

JORAH: They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.

CHAMPION: (CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)

DAENERYS: I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?

GREY WORM: (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.

DAEYNERYS: (valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.

BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.

DAENERYS: Which is why you must remain by my side.

JORAH: I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.

DAENERYS: You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.

DAARIO: I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.

DAENERYS: Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.

MISSANDEI: He is very brave, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.

A squire helps the mounted CHAMPION arm himself. DAENERYS walks up to DAARIO.

DAENERYS: You sure you don't want a horse?

DAARIO: Why would I want a horse?

DAENERYS: Horses are faster than men.

DAARIO: Horses are dumber than men.

DAENERYS steps back and the CHAMPION charges. DAARIO turns to wink at DAENERYS. The CHAMPION closes in and DAARIO draws his dagger, holds it on his shoulder and kisses it. He then launches it at the charging CHAMPION, burying the blade in his horse's foredead. The horse falls in the sand, the CHAMPION rolling away. As he rises, DAARIO dispatches him with a single blow to the neck. He nods to DAENERYS.

The Meeren crowd is shocked. An order is given, and scores of archers on the wall fire at DAENERYS's band. The arrows plant in front of them. DAARIO urinates in response. DAENERYS paces and the Unsullied turn at attention.

DAENERYS: (valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.

The crowd quiets.

DAENERYS: (valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.

The Meereen inhabitants start to move away from the wall, while the Meereen soldiers face outside the wall. The Meereen slaves listen carefully to DAENERYS, while their masters become uncomfortable.

DAENERYS: Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!

The Unsullied move the seige weapons forward. The slaves are emboldened and the inhabitants are taken aback.

DAENERYS: Fire!

The unsullied fire the catapults. Cylindrical logs spin through the air and shatter on the sides of buildings, raining down the empty manacles inside. Civilians and slaves duck as the contents fall among them. A SLAVE picks up an empty choker and looks back at his fearful master.
EXT. MEEREEN AT NIGHT

A Tent outside of Meereen.

MISSANDEI is teaching GREY WORM how to read by a fire.

GREY WORM: My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."

MISSANDEI: Isles. Summer Isles.

GREY WORM: Summer Isles. (speaks Valeryian)

MISSANDEI: (speaks Valeryian) I am from an island called Naath.

GREY WORM: (speaks Valeryian) When they took you?

MISSANDEI: "When did they take me?" I was five years old.

GREY WORM: You remember your home?

MISSANDEI: I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?

GREY WORM: (Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing.

MISSANDEI: That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.

GREY WORM: I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)

MISSANDEI: Kill the masters.

GREY WORM: Kill the masters.

DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY enter. They stand

DAENERYS: How are the lessons coming?

MISSANDEI: Very well, Your Grace.

GREY WORM: Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

DAENERYS:  You'll have to continue later. It's time.

DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY exit, followed by GREY WORM.

EXT. MEEREEN.

Overhead, the shadow of a flying dragon soars in the moonlight. On the ground, the Unsullied run through the rocky landscape. They strain to open a gate in the rockface. GREY WORM lights a torch as do the other Unsullied. They travel through the sewer tunnel.

CUT TO: Meereen slave's quarters.

Many slaves are gathered in the dark chamber, seating and standing.

MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.

ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.

MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.

The slaves look at one another.

MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?

MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?

ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way: the Masters in power and the slaves dead.

GREY WORM and the Unsullied enter.

GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.

The slaves are surprised to see them. ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE and MOSSADOR stand.

GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.

ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?

GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.

ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.

MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) We have no training, weapons.

GREY WORM and the other Unsullied remove their bundles from around their shoulders. The weapons clank as they hit the ground. The salves gather round, and a few tentatively pick up some swords.

GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.

EXT. Meereen streets at night

GREAT MASTER #1 and two guards  walk the empty streets. They encounter some grafitti reading "Kill the Masters."

GREAT MASTER #1: (Curses in Valyrian.)

They look up to a high tower where a Targaryen flag is waving. Suddenly, a mob of slaves comes running at them. The guards run, leaving GREAT MASTER #1 to his own devices. He tries to flee, but more slaves pour around each corner. The slaves shout and set upon him.

EXT. Meereen streets at day

DAENERYS walks among the cheering slaves, flanked by children.

SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN SELMY walk down the steps on the cliff, surrounded by cheering slaves.

SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

They ascend to the overlook, joining GREY WORM and the Unsullied.

SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa!

DAENERYS: Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?

JORAH: 163, Khaleesi.

DAENERYS: Yes, that was it.

DAENERYS looks to GREY WORM, who gives a nod to  UNSULLIED #1.

UNSULLIED #1: (shouts in Valyrian.)

The Unsullied march forth, pressing the citizens of Meereen.

BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.

DAENERYS: I will answer injustice with justice.

CUT TO: The shores of Meeeen.

An Unsullied nails a Meereen citizen to a cross. Others scream. They line the path up the mountainside, each with one hand nailed to the post, pointing the way. The citizens watch. DAENERYS stands on a platform above, surveying the city, under the Targaryen flag. The screams echo.

EXT. King's Landing.

BRONN and JAIME spar by the sea. JAIME attacks and BRONN parries. JAIME pauses, panting and spins his sword. His skills have improved. They exchange attacks. BRONN presses JAIME, and they deadlock. BRONN grabs JAIME's golden hand and swats him across the face. JAIME falls to the ground.

JAIME: What the hell was that?

BRONN: That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.

BRONN tosses JAIME back his hand.

JAIME: You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

BRONN: You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?

JAIME: You talk to my brother this way?

BRONN: All the time. He got used to it.

They sit together on a low wall. JAIME drinks.

JAIME: Do you think he did it?

BRONN: No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?

JAIME doesn't answer.

BRONN: You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

JAIME: We're done for today.

He tosses the water skin to BRONN and starts to walk way

BRONN: Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?

JAIME: You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.

BRONN: Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?

JAIME exits.

INT. Tyrion's cell

JAIME and TYRION sit in the cell.

JAIME: To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.

TYRION: Is that supposed to make me feel better?

JAIME: Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

TYRION: It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?

JAIME: How do you think? Her son died in her arms.

TYRION: Her son?

JAIME: Don't. You know what's coming?

TYRION: My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.

JAIME: Now that you mention it, she did ask.

TYRION: So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

JAIME: Depends. Did you do it?

TYRION: The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?

JAIME: Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?

TYRION: Well, you could set me free.

JAIME: You know I can't.

TYRION: Then there's really nothing else to say.

JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

TYRION: Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.

JAIME: Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.

TYRION: Except I didn't do it.

JAIME: Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

JAIME: Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

TYRION: Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

TYRION: No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.

INT. Littlefinger's ship.

SANSA looks out on the ocean. Littlefinger enters.

SANSA: Where are you taking me?

LITTLEFINGER: I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.

SANSA: Did you kill Joffrey?

LITTLEFINGER:Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.

SANSA: I know it was you.

LITTLEFINGER: And who helped me with this conspiracy?

SANSA: Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.

LITTLEFINGER: Why not?

SANSA: Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

LITTLEFINGER: Then perhaps it was your husband.

SANSA: No.

LITTLEFINGER: How do you know?

SANSA: I just do.

LITTLEFINGER: You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.

SANSA: The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

LITTLEFINGER: A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.

SANSA: I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?

LITTLEFINGER: So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.

SANSA: And what do you want?

LITTLEFINGER: Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?

SANSA: Who could trust you?

LITTLEFINGER: I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.

EXT. King's Landing garden

OLENNA and MARGAERY stroll arm-in-arm in the garden.

MARGAERY: I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.

OLENNA: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

MARGAERY: (laughs)

OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?

MARGAERY: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.

OLENNA: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.

MARGAERY: (laughs)

OLENNA:  How absentminded of me.

MARGAERY: Mm-hmm.

OLENNA: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

MARGAERY: (laughs)

OLENNA: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.

MARGAERY: Well, he could have done.

OLENNA: He could have done,but he didn't.

MARGAERY: You don't know, Grandmother.

OLENNA: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

MARGAERY: What? I don't understand.

OLENNA: Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.

EXT. Castle Black courtyard

Swords clang as the recruits train.

JON: Bring it through! And again.

JON and GRENN spar

JON: Very nice. Good.

JON and GRENN take a break. JON speaks to the recruits.

JON: A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.

JON hands GRENN a second sword. They engage, and JON quickly knocks away one of GRENN's swords. GRENN takes a wide swing, JON ducks, then blocks his forearm and puts his blade to GRENN's throat. OLLY smiles in the crowd and GRENN nods, admitting defeat.

JON: Let's see what you can do.

OLLY steps forward, ready.

JON: Olly, you just watch for now.

OLLY: I can fight.

JON: Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.

The recruits laugh.

OLLY: I was!

GRENN: I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn.

JON: You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other.

LOCKE and another ranger arm themselves. LOCKE bests the bald one.

JON: You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.

LOCKE: He wouldn't have learned anything that way.

ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT enter.

ALLISER THORNE: Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?

JON: Grenn and I were helping them.

ALLISER THORN: Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.

JON: Someone has to train them.

ALLISER THORNE: And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.

JON exits.

ALLISER THORNE: Get back to work. Now! I said now!

JANOS SLYNT: The bastard's well-liked.You're not.

ALLISER THORNE: You think I care if they like me? We're at war.

JANOS SLYNT:   For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.

ALLISER THORNE exits.

CUT TO: the yard armory

JON returns his sword. RECRUIT joins him.

LOCKE: A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.

JON: My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.

LOCKE: Name's Locke.

JON: Jon Snow.

They shake.

JON: You fight well.

LOCKE: What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.

ALLISER THORNE: Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?

LOCKE: Guess I was wrong.

INT. King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.

There is a knocking at CERSEI's door. She drinks, ignoring it. JAIME enters.

JAIME: You sent for me, Your Grace?

CERSEI: Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?

JAIME: Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...

CERSEI: So one? You have one man guarding the future king?

JAIME: I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.

CERSEI: The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?

JAIME: What?

CERSEI:  I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?

JAIME: You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.

CERSEI: She hoped or did you promise?

JAIME: I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.

CERSEI: So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

JAIME: I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?

CERSEI: You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?

JAIME: Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?

JAIME doesn't answer.

CERSEI: I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.

JAIME: I had to see him. I had to know for myself.

CERSEI:  And?

JAIME: He didn't do it, Cersei.

CERSEI: You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.

JAIME exits.

INT. Tommen's bedroom.

TOMMEN lies in his bed. He cannot sleep. He hears a door creaking

TOMMEN: Ser Pounce?

MARGAERY enters.

TOMMEN: How did you get past the Kingsguard?

MARGAERY: Kingsguard.

TOMMEN: I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.

MARGAERY:  I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.

MARGAERY sits on his bed.

MARGAERY: Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?

TOMMEN: Yes. But if my mother found out...

MARGAERY: It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...

TOMMEN: Yes? Tell me a secret.

Sir Pounce jumps onto the bed. MARGAERY pets him

MARGAERY: Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?

TOMMEN: That's Ser Pounce.

MARGAERY: Very handsome.

TOMMEN: Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

MARGAERY: That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.

TOMMEN: No. I don't think I am.

MARGAERY: That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?

TOMMEN: We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast.

MARGAERY: When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.

MARGAERY leans in close.

MARGAERY:  Remember, our little secret.

She kisses TOMMEN on the forehead, and exits.

INT. King's Landing

BRIENNE and JAIME are looking at the history of the Kingsguard.

BRIENNE: "Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."

JAIME: It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.

JAIME picks up a displayed sword, weighs it, and then hands it to BRIENNE. She takes it and admires it.

BRIENNE: Valyrian steel.

JAIME: Mmm. It's yours.

BRIENNE: I can't accept this.

JAIME: It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.

JAIME reveals a suit of armor made for BRIENNE.

JAIME: I hope I got your measurements right.

BRIENNE: I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.

JAIME: I almost forgot. I have one more gift.

EXT. The forrest outside King's Landing

PODRICK beams next to JAIME. BRIENNE paces. BRONN stands in the background.

BRIENNE: I don't need a squire.

JAIME: Of course you do.

BRIENNE:  He'll slow me down.

JAIME: My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.

PODRICK: I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well.

JAIME: See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.

BRONN approaches and clasps PODRICK's shoulder. He unwraps a bundle.

BRONN: Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.

He pushed the axe onto PODRICK's chest.

BRONN: What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.

PODRICK exits

JAIME: They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?

BRIENNE: Oathkeeper.

JAIME: Good-bye, Brienne.

BRIENNE nods and exits. JAIME watches her and PODRICK ride off.

PODRICK: Come on, move.

BRIENNE looks back at JAIME, and rides on.

INT. Castle black library at night.

SAM and JON converse in the library

SAM: I should neverhave taken her away.

JON: She wasn't safe here.

SAM: She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.

JON: Castle Black could be next.

SAM: I should go back for Gilly.

JON: We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.

SAM: I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.

JON: And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.

SAM: I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.

JON: How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?

SAM: I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.

JON: The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...

LOCKE enters

SAM: Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...

LOCKE: Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.

LOCKE exits

INT. Castle Black dining hall

ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLINT sit at the main table.

ALLISER THORNE: Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.

JON: Thank you, Ser Alliser.

JON moves down to the main floor of the hall.

JON: Ahem, brothers.

GRENN knocks against the table to get their attention. The hall quiets.

JON: I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?

GRENN stands. JON Nods. DOLOROUS EDD stands. Three more join, and then LOCKE does.

JON: I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.

LOCKE: Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.

ALLISER THORNE: (nods)

JON: Thank you, brothers.

INT. Craster's Keep, night.

KARL TANNER drinks from a human skull while sounds of rough sex spill from the background.

WOMAN: No, don't. Don't, please.

WOMAN #2: Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.

RAST pours himself some wine. He is drunk.

TANNER: Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.

He spills wine from the skull into his mouth, greedily.

TANNER: Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?

A man rough arms one of Craster's wives into sexual submission. She wails.

TANNER: Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.

TANNER pushes down another of Craster's wives. RAST admires the back of another.

TANNER: Rast.

RAST kisses her shoulder. TANNER grabs some meat and throws it at him.

TANNER: Go outside and feed the beast.

RAST: We should kill that thing.

TANNER: You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

He stands.

TANNER: Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?

He kicks RAST gently

TANNER: Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?

He slaps RAST, goading him.  RAST; I wouldn't stand a chance. None of us would.

TANNER: I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.

SISSY enters with CRASTER'S BABY.

WOMEN:  A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

TANNER: What the fuck is that?

SISSY: Craster's last child. A boy.

TANNER: What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.

TANNER pulls a knife.

TANNER: Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.

SISSY: He didn't kill them. He offered them.

TANNER: To who?

SISSY: To the gods. The white walkers.

WOMEN: A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.

TANNER: Shut up!

TANNER sheaths his knife and takes CRASTER'S BABY from SISSY.

TANNER: So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.

He brings CRASTER'S BABY to RAST.

TANNER: Rast is headed that way.

EXT. North of the Wall

RAST carries CRASTER'S BABY. He places the baby on the ground and walks away. CRASTER'S BABY starts to cry.

CUT TO: Craster's Keep.

RAST returns to the keep. Ghost growls in his cage. RASK opens a flask with his teeth.

RAST: Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?

He takes a drink. Ghost growls. RAST empties the flask in front of him. Ghost starts, and RAST falls back. After he stands, the birds sound and the snow cracks. RAST runs in terror.

RAST: Fuck!

CUT TO: Bran's camp

HODOR, BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and Summer lay around the fire. CRASTER'S BABY's cries in the distance.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: Do you hear that?

MEERA: Is that a baby?

JOJEN: It's coming.

BRAN: I'm going out there.

MEERA: No, we need to stay together.

BRAN: I'm going.

BRAN focusses inwards and his eyes turn white. Summer leaves the camp, inhabited by BRAN. He runs through the woods towards the cries of CRASTER'S BABY. Suddenly the ground gives way.

BRAN gasps and sits up.

JOJEN:  Bran. Bran.

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

MEERA: Bran, what happened?

BRAN: Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.

MEERA: Who?

BRAN: I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost.

EXT. Craster's Keep, morning.

BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and JODOR watch the bustle of the keep.

BRAN: They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.

MEERA: If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?

The rangers handle one of Craster's wives roughly.

MEERA: They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go.

BRAN: No.

MEERA: Bran, we need to go now.

BRAN: I'm not leaving without Summer.

MEERA and JOJEN exchange a silent look.

MEERA: Can you remember where the cage was?

BRAN: The east side of the keep.

MEERA: If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...

A Ranger smashes MEERA in the face, and she falls. BRAN and JOJEN react. HODOR stands.

HODOR: Hodor.

They are surrounded by Night's Watch traitors.

CUT TO: inside the keep.

The traitors yell and prod at HODOR, who is chained around his neck.

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

HODOR tries to undo his bonds. A traitor stabs him in the leg, and he groans, falling back.

HODOR: Hodor.

RAST: If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.

CUT TO: Interior of the Keep

BRAN, MEERA and JOJEN are brought into the keep. BRAN falls to the ground when released.

TANNER: Help him up.

A traitor sits him up. TANNER comes over to BRAN, and fondles his furs.

TANNER: This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?

BRAN does not answer. TANNER rises and slaps him.

TANNER: You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?

TANNER strokes MEERA's hair and face.

TANNER: I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?

TANNER releases MEERA.

TANNER: See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.

JOJEN starts to spasm. He falls to the ground

RAST: What the fuck's wrong with him?

TANNER: Come here.

TANNER grabs MEERA by the hair and pulls her away from JOJEN. He puts a knife to her throat.

MEERA: (screams) No, please. Please.Please, let me help him.

TANNER:  Who are you?

MEERA: Please.

TANNER: Who are you?

BRAN:  I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

RAST: It's Jon Snow's brother.

TANNER releases MEERA and walks over. MEERA runs to JOJEN.

MEERA: It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.

TANNER: And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.

MEERA: I'm right here.

EXT. North of the Wall.

A snow storm howls. A lone horseman appears. It is a WHITE WALKER, riding a dead horse. He holds CRASTER'S BABY. The horse walk across a frozen lake, towards an ominous landscape. Ice cracks as the WHITE WALKER brings the baby to  a stone circle with an altar in the middle. He places CRASTER'S BABY there. The NIGHT KING approaches from a line of white walkers. The NIGHT KING picks up the baby, and pierces his cheek with a long fingernail. The baby's eyes turn blue.
INT. King's Landing: The Iron Throne room

The HIGH SEPTON leads the coronation of TOMMEN. JAIME patrols in the back.

HIGH SEPTON: May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!

ALL: Long may he reign!

The crowd cheers. TOMMEN bows.  MARGAERY and TOMMEN exchange a look.

HIGH SEPTON: Special day.

CUT TO: Later in the Sept

TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne, with TYWIN beside him. A reception line moves towards him, including PYCELLE and VARYS.   (CROWD CHATTING)

PYCELLE: Your Grace.

VARYS: Your Grace.

TOMMEN exchanges nodes and smiles with MARGAERY, who stands in the wings.  CERSEI catches their gaze, and she comes to MARGAERY. The crowd greets her as she passes through.

MAN: Your Grace.

MAN #2:  Your Grace.

MARGAERY: Your Grace.

CERSEI: There he is.

MARGAERY:  Long may he reign.

CERSEI: Long may he reign.

MARGAERY:  He sits the throne like he was born to it.

CERSEI: Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

MARGAERY: No, he wasn't.

CERSEI: You still mourn for Joffrey?

MARGAERY: He was my husband. My king.

CERSEI: He would have been your nightmare.

MARGAERY: Your Grace, I feel...

CERSEI: You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?

MARGAERY: No.

CERSEI: The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

MARGAERY:  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.

CERSEI: He will need help... if he's going to rule well.

MARGAERY: He has you.

CERSEI: A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?

MARGAERY: Oh. After all that's happened... it sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.

CERSEI: Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.

LORAS bows to TOMMEN on the stage.

MARGAERY:  We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.

CERSEI: (CHUCKLES)

MARGAERY: I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.

INT. Meereen council room, day

DAENERYS, BARRISTAN SELMY, DAARIO NAHARIS, JORAH, MISSANDEI AND GREY WORM are meeting.

JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.

BARRISTAN: And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.

DAARIO: The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.

DAENERYS: Who told you to take the Navy?

DAARIO: No one.

DAENERYS: So why did you do it?

DAARIO: I heard you liked ships.

DAENERYS: How many ships?

BARRISTAN: 93, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: How many men can they carry?

BARRISTAN: 9,300, not counting sailors.

DAENERYS: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?

JORAH: The Lannisters have more.

BARRISTAN: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. 8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.

JORAH: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

BARRISTAN: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

JORAH: The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.

JORAH stands.

JORAH: There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."

DAENERYS: Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.

GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, DAARIO and BARRISTAN exit.

DAENERYS:  It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.

JORAH: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.

DAENERYS: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.

JORAH: (CHUCKLES)

DAENERYS: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?

JORAH: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.

DAENERYS: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.

JORAH: What, then?

DAENERYS: I will do what queens do. I will rule.

DAENERYS walks to the balcony.

EXT.  Outside the Aerie.

SANSA and LITTLEFINGER approach the Aerie.

LITTLEFINGER: Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.

SANSA: But how would they know?

LITTLEFINGER: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

SANSA puts up her hood.

SANSA: Is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.

KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

LITTLEFINGER: Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

KNIGHT: Stand to.

KNIGHT #2: Stand to!

KNIGHT #3: Stand to!

KNIGHT: Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

The gate opens noisily, LITTLEFINGER and SANSA step through.

CUT TO: The Aerie throne room.

ROBIN sits on LYSA's lap on the throne. A door opens and LITTLEFINGER and SANSA enter. ROBIN runs down to greet him.

ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!

LITTLEFINGER: My lord.

They embace.

LITTLEFINGER: Oh. I have brought you a gift.

LITTLEFINGER gives ROBIN a glass bird.

LYSA: Lord Baelish.

LITTLEFINGER: My lady.

ROBIN: Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

LYSA descends to greet her visitors.

LYSA: A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

SANSA: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...

LYSA: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

LYSA walks to SANSA, lowers her hood and caresses her face, smiling warmly. They hug.

LYSA: My flesh and blood.

SANSA: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

LYSA: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.

SANSA: Of course. I understand.

LYSA: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.

SANSA: I would never say a thing.

LYSA: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.

ROBIN: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.

SANSA: They did, and my father's.

ROBIN: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.

SANSA: Make him fly?

ROBIN: Through the Moon Door.

He drops the glass bird through the moon door.

ROBIN: (GIGGLES)

LYSA: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.

SANSA: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

LYSA: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?

SANSA: No. - We never...

LYSA: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.

SANSA: It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

LYSA: Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.

LITTLEFINGER: Go. We'll speak soon.

ROBIN leads SANSA out by the hand. LYSA kisses LITTLEFINGER hungrily.

LYSA: What took you so long?

LITTLEFINGER: Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

LYSA: She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.

She kissed him.

LYSA: Let's get married tonight.

LITTLEFINGER: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?

LYSA: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.

LITTLEFINGER: I do think that we could wait until...

LYSA: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?

LITTLEFINGER: Like it was yesterday.

LYSA: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...

LITTLEFINGER kisses LYSA passionately to quiet her. She moans.

LITTLEFINGER: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.

LYSA: (nods)

LITTLEFINGER:  Tonight it is, then.

LYSA: (LAUGHS)

LITTLEFINGER:  Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.

LYSA opens the door and escorts in the septon.

LYSA: I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.

She kisses LITTLEFINGER

CUT TO: SANSA's room, at night

SANSA lies in bed. She can hear LYSA screaming and moaning in ecstacy. SANSA tries to ignore it.

INT. King's Landing, day

TYWIN and CERSEI meet in the Hand's residence.

TYWIN: When will the wedding take place in your mind?

CERSEI: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.

TYWIN:  A fortnight?

CERSEI: That seems reasonable.

TYWIN: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.

CERSEI: (shakes her head)

TYWIN: And your wedding to Loras?

CERSEI: Shortly after Tommen's.

TYWIN: Shortly?

CERSEI: A fortnight.

TYWIN: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.

CERSEI: We had that in common.

TYWIN: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.

CERSEI: Then whom can we trust?

TYWIN: Ourselves alone.

TYWIN rises and pours some wine, handing it to CERSEI. He then pours some for himself.

TYWIN:  The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.

CERSEI: Robert wasn't particularly rich.

TYWIN: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

CESEI: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.

TYWIN: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?

CERSEI: Haven't a clue.

TYWIN:  Go on, your best guess.

CERSEI: Pounds, tons, ounces?

TYWIN:  Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

CERSEI: That can't be.

TYWIN: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

CERSEI: Then how do we pay for anything?

TYWIN: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.

CERSEI: How much?

TYWIN: A tremendous amount.

TYWIN sits.

CERSEI: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

TYWIN: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.

CERSEI: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.

TYWIN: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.

CERSEI: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.

TYWIN: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.

CERSEI: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.

She puts her wine down and stands.

CERSEI: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?

EXT. Westeros woods at night.

ARYA and the HOUND lie by their campfire.

ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.

HOUND: Would you shut up?

ARYA: I can't sleep until I say the names.

HOUND: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?

ARYA: Only the ones I'm going to kill.

HOUND: (CHUCKLES) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

ARYA: If he were here right now, what would you do?

HOUND: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.

ARYA: I'm almost done. Only one name left.

HOUND: Go on.

ARYA: The Hound.

INT. An Aerie dining room, night

LYSA serves SANSA a pastry

SANSA: Thank you.

LYSA: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?

SANSA:  Really?

LYSA:  Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.

SANSA: My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.

LYSA: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?

SANSA eats another. LYSA takes her hand.

SANSA: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.

LYSA: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.

SANSA: Yes. I'm very lucky.

LYSA: He feels responsible for you.

SANSA: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.

LYSA: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?

SANSA: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.

LYSA: Loved your mother.

SANSA: No.

LYSA: That's what you wanted to say.

SANSA: He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.

LYSA: Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?

SANSA: No.

LYSA holds SANSA's hands firmly and won't let go.

LYSA: He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?

SANSA: No, never.

LYSA: Are you pregnant?

SANSA: What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never...

LYSA: I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?

SANSA: Aunt Lysa, no, I...

LYSA: Your young, pretty body.

SANSA: Nothing. I'm a virgin.

LYSA: Don't lie to me.

SANSA: You're hurting me.

LYSA grips harder.

LYSA: I'll know if you lie.

SANSA: I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.

LYSA stands up and hugs SANSA to her breast.

LYSA:  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.

EXT. The Kingsroad.

BRIENNE and PODRICK ride the road. PODRICK struggles a bit.

BRIENNE: Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

PODRICK: Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.

BRIENNE: Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.

PODRICK: That's a long way off.

BRIENNE:Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.

PODRICK: Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

BRIENNE: I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.

PODRICK: All knights have squires, my lady.

BRIENNE: I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.

PODRICK: I swore an oath, my lady.

BRIENNE: I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.

PODRICK: I know.

BRIENNE: What do you think will happen if you leave?

PODRICK: They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.

PODRICK's horse continues to squirm and whinny.

EXT. The camp of the HOUND and ARYA

The HOUND wakes, and notices that ARYA is gone. He panics, looking for her. Nearby, ARYA practices her agile footwork and swordwork with needle.

HOUND: The hell you doing?

ARYA: Practicing.

She continues to practice her steps.

HOUND: What, ways to die?

ARYA:  No one's going to kill me.

HOUND: They will if you Nance around like that. That's no way to fight.

ARYA: It's not fighting. It's water dancing.

HOUND: Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?

ARYA does a one-armed cartwheel.

ARYA: The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

HOUND:  Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.

ARYA: What do you know about anything?

HOUND: I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.

ARYA: It was not.

HOUND: Was? He dead?

ARYA:  Yes.

HOUND: How?

ARYA: He was killed.

HOUND: Who by?

ARYA: Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn...

HOUND:  Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

ARYA:  He was outnumbered.

HOUND:  Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.

ARYA: Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.

HOUND:  The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.

ARYA stabs the HOUND in the gut as hard as she can, grunting. It doesn't pierce his armor. He backhands her, and she falls. He picks up need and threatens her with it.

HOUND: Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)

The hound reverses the sword and hands it back to ARYA.

EXT. KIng's Landing garden.

OBERYN sits writing on a scroll. CERSEI enters, flanked by guards. He stands to greet her.

OBERYN: Your Grace.

CERSEI: Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?

OBERYN:  A poem, actually.

CERSEI: May I show you the gardens?

OBERYN:  I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.

CERSEI: No, you couldn't.

They walk through the gardens.

CERSEI: I didn't realize you were a poet.

OBERYN: Not a very good one.

CERSEI: For your paramour?

OBERYN: For one of my daughters.

CERSEI: You have several, don't you?

OBERYN: Eight.

CERSEI: Eight? Eight daughters?

OBERYN:  The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.

CERSEI: Beautiful name.

OBERYN:  Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.

CERSEI: Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?

OBERYN: Which joke is that?

CERSEI: You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?

OBERYN: We can avenge them.

CERSEI: Yes, we can avenge them.

OBERYN: You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?

CERSEI: I know he did.

OBERYN: We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.

CERSEI: We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.

OBERYN: The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.

CERSEI: I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.

OBERYN: You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.

CERSEI: Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.

OBERYN: Anything at all.

CERSEI points to a sailing ship in the bay.

CERSEI: The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.

OBERYN: I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.

CERSEI: Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.

CERSEI exits.

EXT. The Kingsroad, day

PODRICK is roasting a rabbit. It catches fire.

PODRICK: Oh, no, no, no.

He picks up the spit but the rabbit is engulfed in flames.

PODRICK: No, no, no, no.

He drops the rabbit and stamps it out.

PODRICK: Hells. Gods.

BRIENNE returns with firewood.

BRIENNE: Did you remove the skin?

PODRICK: No, my lady.

BRIENNE: Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?

PODRICK: No, my lady.

BRIENNE: Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?

PODRICK: No, my lady. That was the cooks.

BRIENNE sits down, exasperated. She begins to remove her armor. PODRICK rushes over to help.

BRIENNE: What are you doing?

PODRICK: I'm helping you with your armor.

BRIENNE: I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.

PODRICK backs away

BRIENNE: What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?

PODRICK: I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.

BRIENNE: Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?

PODRICK: I killed a man.

BRIENNE: Who?

PODRICK: A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

BRIENNE: How did you kill a Kingsguard?

PODRICK: I pushed a spear through the back of his head.

BRIENNE starts to remove her armor straps again.

BRIENNE:  Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.

PODRICK gets up quickly to help.

EXT. Craster's Keep, evening.

RAST leads a WOMAN roughly away from the Keep. LOCKE is watching from behind a tree. RAST pushes the whimpering WOMAN down and laughs.

RAST: Hey. Hey, get up. Get up.

RAST grabs her shirt from behind and pulls her up. The WOMAN sobs. RAST pushes her forward.. They pass by RAST. A company of men emerges from the keep.

MAN: That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.

MAN #2: Aye. What we need is a girl there.

MAN: I've got to have a piss.

LOCKE sneaks into the grounds.

MAN: Now keep quiet.

LOCKE creeps closer to the main keep, knocking a lantern as he passes, causing it to rattle and then squeak as it swings. He looks into the keep and sees the bound captives as well as some of the traitor rangers.

CUT TO: INT, Craster's Keep.

Within the keep, BRAN hears the squeaking, looks up and sees the swinging lantern. MEERA is also curious. JOJEN coughs

MEERA: You need water.

JOJEN: It doesn't matter.

MEERA: Of course it matters.

JOJEN: You mustn't let anything stop you.

BRAN: They already have stopped me.

JOJEN: No. You're not here. You're far from here.

MEERA: What does that mean?

JOJEN has a vision. The outer wall of the keep disappears, and behind the bound BRAN, the red leaves of a wierwood reaches out in the sunset.

JOJEN: At the hill. A great weirwood tree.

BRAN: You've seen it, too.

JOJEN: Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.

BRAN: We will.

JOJEN: This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.

MEERA: How... will we know the end?

JOJEN looks at his hand. In his vision, it is on fire.

JOJEN: You'll know.

CUT TO: Exterior, Craster's Keep

LOCKE moves stealthily through the woods. He arrives back at the ranger encampment.

LOCKE: Brothers.

JON, DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN step to meet him.

DOLOROUS EDD: You do move quiet.

JON: How many?

LOCKE: 11 men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.

GRENN: Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.

LOCKE: Have you seen what I can do with a knife?

GRENN: (CHUCKLES) Not yet.

LOCKE: There's a hut on the West Side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.

JON: Why?

LOCKE: They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.

GRENN: New moon tonight.

JON: (SIGHS) Get some rest. We move at sundown.

CUT TO: EXT Craster's Keep

The Keep grounds are lit by torches. A door opens brusquely. KARL and some rangers stride forth, heading to the main keep.

KARL: I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.

They enter the main building.

TANNER: Get her up.

Two rangers untie MEERA. She stuggles as they bring her to her feet. x

BRAN: Stop.

JOJEN: Stop. What are you doing?

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

BRAN: Stop. Stop!

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.

The traitors raise MEERA's hands above her head to place them into manacles that hang from the beam above.

BRAN: Stop! Please.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN:  Please, get off her!

HODOR:  Hodor. Hodor.

MEERA has been put into the manacles, hands raised over her head. JOJEN watches.

BRAN: Please! Please, leave her alone!

BRAN: Please, stop. Stop.

They bind her feet as well.

BRAN: What are you doing? Leave her alone!

HODOR:  Hodor. Hodor.

BRAN: No!

KARL TANNER steps towards her.

KARL: Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

MEERA: (gasps)

KARL: Shh.

MEERA: (whimpers)

KARL touches her hair.

KARL: You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?

JOJEN: If you let my sister go, I can help you.

KARL: You can help me?

JOJEN: I can.

KARL:And how you gonna do that?

JOJEN: I have the sight. I can see things.

KARL: That's very helpful.

JOJEN: Things that haven't happened yet.

KARL: What a fine thing. A fine thing.

KARL kneels before JOJEN.

KARL: Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?

JOJEN: No.

KARL draws a knife.

KARL: Don't close your eyes.

KARL TANNER turns and stands, stepping back towards MEERA.

JOJEN: I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.

MAN: To arms!

RAST enters.

RAST: They're here, the Night's Watch.

KARL TANNER exits.

CUT TO: Exterior of the Keep

The Night's Watch attack the camp, shouting and screaming. They engage with the traitors, battling with swords. GRENN, JON and LOCKE all dispatch their foes. LOCKE moves intently to the main keep.

CUT TO: Keep interior

LOCKE enters to find BRAN, HODOR, JOJEN and MEERA bound.

LOCKE: Rescue party is here, lads. Lady.

BRAN: Is Jon with you?

LOCKE: Aye. I'll take you to him.

LOCKE cuts BRAN's bonds.

LOCKE: You're Brandon Stark?

BRAN doesn't answer. LOCKE slices him with his knife, testing the feeling in his legs.

MEERA:  (GASPS)

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.

LOCKE: The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.

BRON: Jon! Jon!

LOCKE covers BRAN's mouth with his gloved hand to silence him.

LOCKE: Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?

CUT TO: Keep Exterior

The battle rages. The Night's Watch is winning

CUT TO: Keep Interior

BRAN sits silently. Lock unbinds him further.

HODOR: Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.

LOCKE lifts him onto his shoulders.

HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

BRAN's eyes turn white, as does HODOR's. HODOR rocks methodically, pulling his chains free from the wall.

CUT TO: Keep Exterior

Jon and the rangers continue to battle against the traitors. JON dispatches man after man.

CUT TO: The woods just beyond the keep

LOCKE carries BRAN, trudging through the woods. HODOR appears and knocks BRAN from LOCKE's shoulder. Both BRAN and HODOR have white eyes: BRAN is in control of the giant. HODOR holds LOCKE above him with one had around his neck. LOCKE chokes and strains. HODOR twists his hand quickly, spanning LOCKE's neck. HODOR drops the lifeless body.

BRAN: Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.

HODOR is dsazed, confused.

BRAN: Hodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor.

HODOR picks up the knife and cuts BRAN's bonds.

BRAN: Jojen and Meera, free them. Go!

HODOR exits. BRAN can hear the sounds of the battle.

BRAN: Jon.

CUT TO: Keep Exterior

JON fights relentlessly. BRAN crawls closer to the camp.

BRAN: Jon!

JON doesn't hear him in the noise of the battle. JOJEN appears.

JOJEN: If he sees you, he won't let you go north.

BRAN:  He's my brother.

JOJEN: And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.

BRAN watches JON at battle.

JOJEN: You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?

BRAN considers. He watches JON from afar. BRAN makes up his mind.

BRAN: Hodor.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: We need to free Summer. And we need to go.

JOJEN and HODOR help him up.

CUT TO: Keep interior

KARL TANNER stabs a Night's Watchman in the neck. JON enters. KARL TANNER pulls his knife back and bows.

KARL TANNER: Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?

KARL TANNER spins his knives and walks towards Jon.

KARL TANNER: We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.

They battle, JON's sword against KARL TANNER's knives. It is an even match. They pause for breath.

KARL TANNER: You learn how to fight in a castle?

They engage again. KARL TANNER gets the upper hand and stabs JON in the leg. JON groans.

KARL TANNER: Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?

JON frees himself from the dagger and they battle again. KARL TANNER has the upper hand.

KARL TANNER: How to fight with honor?

JON slices KARL TANNER's face, who falls back. They grapple and parry.

KARL TANNER: You know what's wrong with honor?

KARL TANNER spits in JON's face, then sweeps his legs from under him. JON falls and KARL TANNER kicks at him, then stomps on JON's hand to prevent him from grabbing his sword. A stabbing sounds, and KARL TANNER drops his knifes and stumbles backward. SISSY has put a knife in his back. She looks terrified.

KARL TANNER: You.

KARL TANNER reaches back to remove the knife, while walking towards SISSY. She backs away and falls, and KARL TANNER successfully dislodges the knife. He menaces her with it. Suddenly, JON's sword pieces through KARL TANNER's mouth. JON slowly withdraws his bloody blade. KARL TANNER falls dead atop SISSY. JON kneels down to her.

JON: Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.

CUT TO: EXT, Craster's Keep

GRENN slays a traitor. JON and SISSY emerge from the building. DOLOROUS EDD drags LOCKE's body to the others. SISSY runs to MORAG and others of Craster's wives.

JON: We lost four brothers?

DOLOROUD EDD: Five.

They look down at LOCKE. His neck it grotesquely twisted.

GRENN: What the seven hells could do that to a man?

JON: I count 10 dead mutineers.

GRENN: Locke said there were 11 of them.

DOLROUS EDD: Where's Rast?

CUT TO: The woods outside the Keep

RAST runs through the woods. He passes by the cages where the wolves had been penned. They are open. He looks about, and Ghost lunges on top of him. RAST screams.

CUT TO: EXT, Craster's Keep

GRENN, JON and a Night's Watchman survey the grounds. The MAN hands JON a sword.

MAN: Here's another.

GRENN: Jon.

Ghost approaches.

JON: Where in seven hells? Come here.

Ghost whines. JON pets him.

JON: I missed you, boy.

DOLOROUS EDD: What should we do with this lot?

JON: It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.

MORAG: Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way.

JON: You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?

MORAG spits.

MORAG: Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.

CUT TO: The Keep Burning.

JON, DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN watch the keep burn. So do MORAG, SISSY and the remaining wives. The building begins to collapse.
You're accused of killing the king.
I didn't do it.
Which is why we're having a trial.
One of my three judges is my father.
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I want you to be the third.
I will also invite you to sit on the Small Council.
I never realized you had such respect for Dorne.
What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
You can avenge them.
You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
You're still interested in being queen, I take it?
It would be a great honor.
But I will have to speak to my father about it.
I will speak to mine.
You started wars to protect this family's future.
Tyrion deserves for lighting our future to fire.
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
The kind who serves his king.
The next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.
How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?
- I am loyal servant! - Throw him in one of the black cells.
Oh no, no, no, no.
There are many who know that without you, this city faced certain defeat.
The king won't give you any honors, but we will not forget.
The city is yours. All these people are your subjects now.
Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
I will answer injustice with justice.
"Find a special gift.
"Theon's favorite toy.
"He cried when I took it away from him."
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
and I'm going to bring him home.
We need to look East for ships and men.
- Soldiers win wars. - We don't have any gold.
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos, which means you're running out of time.

Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--
We've been here since midday.
Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.
Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
Together, we were going to run
three shiploads of the finest--
Welcome to the Iron Bank.
Please, sit.
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,
King of the Andals and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
The Iron Throne is currently occupied
by Tommen of the House Baratheon,
King of the Andals and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
He shares no blood with me.
He is a bastard born of incest.
As was his brother before him.
Yes, we have heard this story.
It's not a story. It's the truth.
The king's grandfather tells a different story.
A story about a jealous uncle
whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king
cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
Gold you loaned him.
And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
More than any man living.
Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled
with words like "usurper" and "madman"
and "blood right."
Here, our books are filled with numbers.
We prefer the stories they tell.
More plain.
Less open to interpretation.
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
4,000.
And how many ships do you have?
The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,
not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
32.
And how much wheat and barley and beef
and pork do you produce on Dragonstone
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
None.
You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up
to a happy ending from our perspective.
I'm afraid we must respectfully
decline your request.
But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
My lord.
I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
You would not be either here.
In Braavos,
thieves are not rewarded with titles.
Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.
That would be the pirates.
I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
This is the payment that was demanded
by King Stannis for my crimes.
I consider it an honest accounting.
He's an honest man and he's your best chance
to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.
Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
The war is over.
As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
Who's the real power in King's Landing?
- Ser Davos... - Humor me.
-  Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister?
- 67. - 67. And when he dies, who's in command?
A half-grown boy,
the product of incest?
Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?
Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?
When Tywin's gone, who do you back?
That is a problem for another time.
Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.
There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
Stannis.
He's got the birthright.
He's in his prime.
He's a tried and tested battle commander.
And he doesn't just talk about paying people back,
he does it.
The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
The captain shouts to his first mate,
"Bring me my red shirt."
The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
And when the pirates try to board,
the brave captain leads his men to victory.
A few days later, the lookout screams,
"Two pirate ships!"
The crew is shivering like scared mice.
But the courageous captain hollers,
"Bring me my red shirt!"
After the battle, the first mate asks,
"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"
The captain replies,
"So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."
The next morning the lookout screams,
"10 pirate ships!
We are surrounded!"
The crew goes silent.
They all look to their brave captain,
waiting for his usual command.
Calm as ever, the captain bellows...
"Bring me my brown pants!"
You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
Davos.
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
Only half rotted.
Join us, my friend. Join us.
This is Lhara.
- And this is-- - I am Lhara.
She's an artist, this one, truly.
No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
We?
You, me-- we.
Once I thought this man loved me.
Now I know he despises me.
He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
You won't be alone.
And you won't be poor.
There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
I gave it to your wife.
You're not my friend, my friend.
I'll see you at sunrise.
"I give you until the full moon
to order all ironborn scum out of the North
and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home.
On the first night of the full moon,
I will hunt down every islander still on our lands
and flay them living,
the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at Winterfell.
In the box you'll find a special gift--
Theon's favorite toy.
He cried when I took it away from him.
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow
with more Theon.
Signed Ramsay Snow,
natural born son of Roose Bolton,
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."
Yes!
They skinned our countrymen
and they mutilated my brother,
your prince.
Your prince.
Everything they've done to him,
they've also done to you.
Yes! Yes!
As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity,
the word ironborn means nothing.
Go left.
- Theon Greyjoy. - I don't know--
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.
Take me to the dungeons.
He's not in the dungeons.
- Last cage on the right. - Thank you.
This way!
We're going home.
No!
It's all right. It's me, Yara.
You can't trick me.
Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
Not Theon! Reek!
- Reek! My name is Reek! -  They're here.
If they catch us in here, we're trapped.
Help me with him.
No, you can't!
- You can't! - You're Theon Greyjoy.
No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!
I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek!
Good Reek! I've always been Reek!
This is turning into a lovely evening.
I'm Reek!
Loyal Reek!
Aah! Theon!
Give me my broth You've got bigger balls than he ever did.
But with those big balls of yours...
how fast can you run?
Make for the ship, now.
But your brother.
My brother is dead.
I have a treat for you.
A reward.
Reward?
Yes, Reek.
Those creatures who came in the night,
they wanted to take you away.
And you didn't let them.
You remained loyal.
I-- I didn't want them to take me.
I was so scared.
- I didn't want them-- - Yes, yes, Reek.
It's a bath.
For you.
Remove those rags.
Now.
The britches, too, Reek.
Take them off.
Do you love me, Reek?
Yes, of course, my lord.
Good.
Because I need you to do something for me.
Something very important.
There's a castle, you see.
Some bad men hold this castle.
I need your help to take this castle back.
But how can--
I need you to play a role.
To pretend to be someone you're not.
Pretend to be who?
Theon Greyjoy.

He is a goatherd.
He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
I thank him for his prayers.
It was your dragons, he says.
They came this morning for his flock.
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace,
but now he has nothing.
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
I cannot bring back his goats,
but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
Send the next one in.

Queen Daenerys.
Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
I thank you.
Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
Then it is my honor to receive you.
My father, one of Meereen's most respected
and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration
and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
This pyramid included.
For that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honored to meet him.
You have, Your Grace.
You crucified him.
I pray you'll never live to see
a member of your family treated so cruelly.
Your father crucified innocent children.
My father spoke out against crucifying those children.
He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
I am sorry you no longer have a father,
but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
You'd be wise to remember that.
What's done is done.
You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
And what traditions do you speak of?
The tradition of funeral rite.
Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
My father and 162 noble Meereenese
are still nailed to those posts,
carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down
so that they might receive proper burials.
And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
They were rotting in the sun as well.
Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
Let me take his body down.
Let me have him brought to the temple
and buried with dignity
so that he might find peace in the next world.
Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
Thank you, my queen.
How many more?
There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
212?
Send the next one in.
These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they?
I was up late last night.
So, does this mean I am a master of something now?
Coins, ships?
Lord Tywin and I already determined
that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor
to have been granted a seat on this council. I--
The trial begins this afternoon.
We only have the morning for affairs of state.
Shall we begin?
Sandor Clegane has been spotted
in the Riverlands, my lord.
A coward and a traitor.
My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
Disgraceful.
What would it take to make the common soldier
stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
Make it 100. What else?
More whispers from the east, my lord.
The Targaryen girl?
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
Conquered with what?
She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.
Some 8,000 strong.
She has a company of sellswords--
the Second Sons.
She has two knights advising her--
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
And she has three dragons.
Baby dragons.
Larger every year, Your Grace.
Mormont is spying on her for us.
No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her.
As for Ser Barristan, it would seem
he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard
a bit harder than anticipated.
He's an old man.
He wasn't fit to protect my son.
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.
Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her
and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
Lord Varys is right.
I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
They are very impressive on the battlefield.
Less so in the bedroom.
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
Armies win them all the time.
She must be dealt with.
How, my lord?
By force?
Eventually, if it comes to that.
Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
Fetch my quill and paper.
Prince Oberyn.
Lord Varys...
Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.
No one is under obligation to call me lord.
And yet everyone does.
You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
Did you spend much time in Essos?
Five years.
May I ask why?
'Tis a big and beautiful world.
Most of us live and die
in the same corner where we were born
and never get to see any of it.
I don't want to be most of us.
Most of us aren't princes.
You are from Essos.
Where? Lys?
I have an ear for accents.
I've lost my accent entirely.
I have an ear for that as well.
How did you get here?
It's a long story.
One you don't like telling people.
People I trust.
My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
You should come to the brothel and meet her.
We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
You did like boys before?
Really?
Girls? Hmm.
I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
Not at all.
But I was never interested in girls, either.
- What then? -  Nothing.
Everybody is interested in something.
Not me.
When I see what desire does to people,
what it's done to this country,
I am very glad to have no part in it.
Besides, the absence of desire
leaves one free to pursue other things.
Such as?
Let me guess, I've been pardoned.
Really?
Father's orders.
Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
Kingslayer!
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,
First of my Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men,
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King,
Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell
and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
And if found guilty...
may the gods punish the accused.
Tyrion of the House Lannister,
you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
Did you kill King Joffrey?
No.
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
Not that I know of.
How would you say he died, then?
Choked on his pigeon pie.
So you would blame the bakers?
Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
The crown may call its first witness.
Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away
from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
He slapped the king across the face
and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
Right here in this throne room,
he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
Compared His Grace to the Mad King
and suggested he'd meet the same fate.
And when I spoke in the king's defense,
he threatened to have me killed.
Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
- Silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark
while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Silence!
You will not speak unless called upon.
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
Basilisk venom,
widow's blood,
wolfsbane,
essence of nightshade,
sweetsleep,
tears of Lys,
demon's dance...
blind eye--
I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
You have a lot of poison in your store.
Had, Prince Oberyn.
My stores were plundered.
By whom?
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister,
after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
Grand Maester,
you examined King Joffrey's corpse.
Was it without question poison that killed him?
Without question.
This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard,
the king's fool.
He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark,
the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
She wore this necklace
the day of the wedding.
Residue of a most rare
and terrible poison was found inside.
Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
It was. The Strangler.
A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
And used to strike down the most noble child
the gods ever put on this good earth.
"I will hurt you for this.
A day will come when you think you are safe and happy
and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth
and you will know the debt is paid."
Your own brother said this to you?
Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
As it turned out, when the attack came,
Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
Tyrion said,
"And you will know the debt is paid."
What debt?
I discovered he'd been keeping whores
in the Tower of the Hand.
I asked him to confine his salacious acts
to the brothel where such behavior belongs.
He wasn't pleased.
Thank you, Your Grace,
for the courage of your testimony.
Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
I'm afraid I do, my lord.
He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.
Monsters are dangerous
and just now kings are dying like flies."
And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
Yes.
After we received word of Robb Stark's death.
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark
had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
You're excused, Lord Varys.
Father, may I ask the witness one question?
One.
You once said
that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
You said the histories would never mention me,
but you would not forget.
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
Sadly, my lord,
I never forget a thing.
We will adjourn for now.
Toll the bells in an hour's time.
Clear the court!
You'd condemn your own son to death?
I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
This isn't a trial. It's a farce.
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
I know nothing of the sort.
- You've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king.
As did I.
Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
To bring him your head.
I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice?
I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
- He'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly.
Once you said family is what lives on.
All that lives on.
You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.
What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
I'm a Kingsguard,
forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
I'm well aware of your oath.
What happens to your name?
Who carries the lion banner into future battles?
Your nephews?
Lancel Lannister?
Others whose names I don't even remember?
What happens to my dynasty
if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
It survives through me.
I'll leave the Kingsguard.
I'll take my place as your son and heir
if you let Tyrion live.
Done.
When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.
In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black
and live out his days at the Wall.
You'll remove your white cloak immediately.
You will leave King's Landing
to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
You will marry a suitable woman
and father children named Lannister.
And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
You have my word.
And you have mine.
Not going well, is it?
- You're going to be found guilty. - Oh, you think so?
When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy
and ask to be sent to the Wall.
Father's agreed to it.
He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
Ned Stark was promised the same thing
and we both know how that turned out.
Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
How do you know?
Do you trust me?
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.
This will all be over soon.
The crown may call its next witness.
State your name.
Shae.
Do you swear by all the gods
that your testimony will be true and honest?
I swear it.
Do you know this man?
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
How do you know him?
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
What do you know of this?
I know that he's guilty.
He and Sansa planned it together.
Silence!
Continue.
She wanted revenge for her father,
her mother, her brother.
She blamed their deaths on the king.
Tyrion was happy to help.
He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.
He hated you, my lord.
He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber
to put in Joffrey's wine.
How could you possibly know all this?
Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
I wasn't just her maid.
I was his whore.
I beg your pardon?
You said you were his...
His whore.
How did you come to be in his service?
He stole me.
I was with another man,
a knight in your lordship's army.
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp,
he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
"You belong to me now," he said.
"I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."
Silence. Silence!
And did you?
Did I what?
Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
I did everything he wanted.
Whatever he told me to do to him.
Whatever he felt like doing to me.
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.
I let him put himself where he wanted.
I was his property.
I would wait in his chambers for hours
so he could use me when he was bored.
He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did.
I took his face in my hands and said,
"I am yours and you are mine."
Shae.
Please don't.
I am a whore.
Remember?
That was before he married Sansa.
After that, all he wanted was her.
But she wouldn't let him into her bed.
So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
I wish to confess.
I wish... to confess.
You wish to confess?
I saved you.
I saved this city
and all your worthless lives.
I should have let Stannis kill you all.
Tyrion.
Do you wish to confess?
Yes, Father.
I'm guilty.
Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
You admit you poisoned the king?
No, of that I'm innocent.
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
Oh, yes, I am.
I've been on trial for that my entire life.
Have you nothing to say in your defense?
Nothing but this--
I did not do it.
I did not kill Joffrey,
but I wish that I had.
Watching your vicious bastard die
gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.
I wish I was the monster you think I am.
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
I would gladly give my life
to watch you all swallow it.
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
And I know I'll get no justice here.
So I will let the gods decide my fate.
I demand a trial by combat.
INT. King's Landing, Tyrion's Cell, day

JAIME and TYRION stand in the jail cell.

JAIME: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.

TYRION: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

JAIME: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?

TYRION: Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't-- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.

JAIME: You fell in love with a whore.

TYRION: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.

JAIME: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.

TYRION: At least I got to tell them what they really are.

JAIME: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.

TYRION: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.

JAIME: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

TYRION: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.

JAIME: (laughs)

TYRION: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.

JAIME: It is tempting.

TYRION: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.

JAIME: If he wins.

TYRION: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.

JAIME: No. Not Ser Meryn.

EXT. King's Landing battle pit, day

The MOUNTAIN gores a prisoner on his great sword, heaving him mightily into the air. Blood streams from his mouth as the MOUNTAIN discards his body onto the sand. CERSEI watches. A line of filthy prisoners wait for a similar fate, a pair of guards behind them. A GUARD pushes the next PRISONER forward.

GUARD: Go on, move it.

The GUARD pushes PRISONER #2 forward. They reach

GUARD: And you. Come on.

The prisoners reach down to pick up meager weapons. PRISONER #1 attacks the MOUNTAIN, who parries and then disembowels him with a single blow. He takes a step forward. PRISONER #2 throws down his weapon and drops to his knees. The line of prisoners panics and the guards work to contain them.

PRISONER #2: Mercy. Please. Please, mercy.

CERSEI enters as the MOUNTAIN dispatches PRISONER #2 with a series of overhead blows.

CERSEI: Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.

CERSEI looks down.

CERSEI: You seem to be in good form.

MOUNTAIN: Who am I fighting?

CERSEI: Does it matter?

MOUNTAIN: (Shakes his head.)

EXT. The Riverlands.

ARYA and the HOUND ride up to a smoldering farm.

HOUND: Could be food.

ARYA: Could be soldiers.

ARYA and the HOUND dismount and explore the farm. They come upon a DYING MAN, who sits propped up with a gut wound.

ARYA: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.

DYING MAN: Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.

HOUND: Who were "they"?

DYING MAN: I stopped asking a while ago.

The HOUND kneels down to inspect his wound.

HOUND: That's not gonna get better.

DYING MAN: Doesn't seem so.

HOUND: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?

DYING MAN: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.

ARYA kneels.

ARYA: So why go on?

DYING MAN: Habit.

ARYA: Nothing could be worse than this.

DYING MAN: Maybe nothing is worse than this.

ARYA: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.

DYING MAN: Who are you?

ARYA: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.

DYING MAN: You her father?

HOUND: (Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

DYING MAN: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.

Thje HOUND gives him a drink of water.

DYING MAN: Wish it were wine.

HOUND: So do I.

The HOUND stabs the DYING MAN in the heart. He dies. The HOUND wipes the blood from his knife on the man's arm.  HOUND. That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.

Suddenly, BITER jumps onto the the HOUND's back, shouting and biting his neck. The HOUND throws BITER down, breaking his neck in the process. He turns to see RORGE, weapon drawn.

HOUND: The fuck you doing?

RORGE: There's a price on your head.

HOUND: Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off. The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.

HOUND: And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?

ARYA: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.

HOUND: This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?

ARYA: He can't be. I don't know his name.

HOUND: What's your name?

RORGE:  Rorge.

ARYA: Thank you.

ARYA draws needle quickly and pierces RORGE in the heart. He groans and falls. ARYA wipes her sword clean on his body.

HOUND: You're learning.

EXT. Castle Black courtyard.

The rangers train in the yard.  A horn blows

MAN: Rangers returning!

MAN #2: They return!

JON, GRENN, DOLOROUS EDD and their party enter. The men in the yard greet them, including SAM.

MAN #2: Rangers returning!

JON: Greetings.

MAN #3: Didn't think I'd see you again.

JON and SAM hug.

SAM: All right, Jon?

MAN #4: Welcome back, brother.

ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT enter on the platform above.

ALLISER: Lord Snow.

JON finishes greeting OLLY. They all look up. Ghost barks.

ALLISER: This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.

JON turns and walks away

JON: Come on, Ghost.

INT. Castle Black Hall.

The Night's Watch is gathered for a meeting. From the floor, JON addresses ALLISER THRONE who sits at the elevated table with JANOS SLYNT. First builder YARWICK also sits at the head table.

JON: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.

JANOS SLYNT: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?

JON: We need to prepare. ALLISER" We've been preparing.

JON: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.

ALLISER: And how would we range north?

JON: We wouldn't.

ALLISER: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?

GRENN: We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men.

ALLISER: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.

JON: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.

ALLISER: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.

JON: They won't stop them.

ALLISER: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.

JON: The stewards.

ALLISER: Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?

JON: No.

ALLISER: Who would that be?

JON: The builders.

ALLISER:Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?

YARWICK: (Pauses.) No.

ALLISER: Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.

The room laughs.

ALLISER: Moving on. First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.

YARWICK: Aye.

JON sits in frustration.

INT. TYRION's cell.

TYRION sits and looks out the window. A door opens beyond his cell. BRONN walks down the stairs and is let into the cell.

BRONN: My lord.

TYRION: You have new clothes.

BRONN:  Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.

TYRION: I sent for you days ago.

BRONN:  I've been a bit busy.

TYRION: Doing what?

BRONN: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

TYRION: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

BRONN: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

TYRION: She's dim-witted.

BRONN: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

TYRION: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?

BRONN: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.

TYRION: And you understand the rules of inheritance?

BRONN: Falyse is 40 and barren.

TYRION: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.

BRONN: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.

TYRION: (scoffs.)

BRONN: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.

TYRION: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?

BRONN sits.

BRONN: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.

TYRION: Is it two wives you want or two castles?

BRONN: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.

TYRION: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

BRONN: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?

TYRION: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.

BRONN: Your sister's a Lannister, too.

TYRION: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.

BRONN: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.

TYRION: Does he frighten you so much?

BRONN: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... ...and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?

TYRION: Because you're my friend.

BRONN: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?

TYRION doesn't answer. BRONN stands.

BRONN: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.

TYRION: I understand.

BRONN: I'm sorry it has to be this way.

TYRION: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.

TYRION extends his hand and BRONN shakes it heartily.

BRONN: We had some good days together.

TYRION: Yes, we did.

BRONN pats TYRION's arm, then walks to knock on the door.

BRONN: What will you do?

TYRION: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?

BRONN: I hope to hear them sing it one day.

BRONN exits.

INT. Meereen, DAENERYS's chambers at night.

DAENERYS enters to find DAARIO in her chambers.

DAENERYS: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,

DAARIO: but your window is not.

DAENERYS walks to DAARIO, and he hands her some flowers.

DAARIO: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.

She hands them back.

DAENERYS: Don't do that again.

DAARIO: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.

DAENERYS: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.

DAENERYS sits. DAARIO kneels playfully for forgiveness.

DAARIO: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you. DAENERYS" Tell me why you're here.

DAARIO rises.

DAARIO: I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world-- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.

DAENERYS: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.

DAARIO: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

DAENERYS: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.

DAARIO: There is only one, and she does not want me.

DAENERYS: You swore me your sword.

DAARIO: My sword is yours till the day I die.

DAENERYS: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?

DAARIO: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.

DAENERYS: Very well.

DAENERYS stands and pours herself some wine.

DAENERYS: Do what you do best.

She sits.

DAENERYS: Take off your clothes.

DAARIO smiles. DAENERYS watches has he removes his clothes.

INT. Bathing room at Storm's End, night

MELISANDRE lies in the bath. After knocking, SELYSE enters.

SELYSE: Oh.

MELISANDRE: Come in, my queen. Please.

SELYSE: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

MELISANDRE: You could never disturb me.

SELYSE: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.

MELISANDRE: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.

SELYSE reaches for a vial, but MELISANDRE stops her.

MELISANDRE: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.

SELYSE brings over the vial and MELISANDRE shakes some into the bath. She sighs.

MELISANDRE: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count." A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

SELYSE: It was. I-- humor isn't my strength.

MELISANDRE: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.

SELYSE: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?

MELISANDRE: Not always.

MELISANDRE leaves the bath and walks to the potions

MELISANDRE: Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.

SELYSE: Did you use it with Stannis?

MELISANDRE: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.

MELISANDRE touches SELYSE on the cheek.

MELISANDRE: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.

MELISANDRE puts on her robe.

SELYSE: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.

MELISANDRE takes her hand.

MELISANDRE: I understand how you feel.

SELYSE: Hmm.

MELISANDRE: But that is impossible.

SELYSE: Why?

MELISANDRE: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

They look into the fire.

MELISANDRE: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.

INT. Meeren hallway.

DAARIO walks down the hall, encountering JORAH.

DAARIO: Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.

DAARIO pats JORAH on the shoulder and exits.

INT. DAENERYS's chambers.

DAENERYS stands in her chambers. JORAH enters.

JORAH: Khaleesi.

DAENERYS: You're here early.

JORAH: Later than some.

DAENERYS: You don't approve?

JORAH: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.

DAENERYS: You neither approve nor trust.

JORAH: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

DAENERYS: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?

JORAH: I did.

DAENERYS: I trust you.

JORAH: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?

DAENERYS: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

JORAH: You have?

DAENERYS: I have.

JORAH: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.

DAENERYS: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.

JORAH: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.

DAENERYS: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?

JORAH: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.

DAENERYS: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.

JORAH: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

DAENERYS: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.

JORAH: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.

DAENERYS considers.

DAENERYS: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.

JORAH: Hizdahr zo Loraq?

DAENERYS: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.

JORAH: (Nods.)

DAENERYS:  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.

JORAH: Yes, Khaleesi.

JORAH starts to exit.

DAENERYS: No. Tell him you changed my mind.

JORAH exits.

EXT. The Riverlands, day

The HOUND and ARYA sit by the fire. The HOUND tends clumsily to his neck wound.

HOUND: Rat cunts. Fucking whore.

ARYA: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right--

HOUND: No fire.

ARYA stands and takes a flaming stick to the HOUND.

ARYA: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.

The HOUND stands and backs away.

HOUND: No fire!

They stand silently. ARYA turns and puts the stick back in the fire. She sits and polishes needle.

HOUND: Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.

The HOUND sits.

HOUND: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword.

He points to his face.

HOUND: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

ARYA: Why?

HOUND: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?

ARYA: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.

The HOUND doesn't answer. ARYA stands and walks to him. She pours water on his wound and begins to sew it.

INT. An Inn, night.

BRIENNE and PODRICK sit for dinner. The server places a pie in front of them.

BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.

PODRICK drinks greedily from his cup.

PODRICK: Couldn't agree more, my lady.

BRIENNE: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.

PODRICK: Yes, my lady.

BRIENNE stops PODRICK from drinking.

BRIENNE: Don't get drunk.

PODRICK: No, my lady.

HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?

BRIENNE: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.

HOT PIE: Thanks. I do my best.

HOT PIE sits.

HOT PIE: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?

BRIENNE: No.

HOT PIE: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?

BRIENNE: We're looking for someone.

HOT PIE: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17--

BRIENNE: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.

HOT PIE: Starks? What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

HOT PIE stands and starts to go.

HOT PIE: sNo, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here.

BRIENNE:  I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.

HOT PIE: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

EXT. Outside the Inn.

BRIENNE and PODRICK prepare the horses.

BRIENNE: What?

PODRICK: It's nothing, my lady.

BRIENNE:  You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.

PODRICK: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't. You're not interesting enough to be offensive. The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.

HOT PIE enters.

HOT PIE: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

BRIENNE: What about? Not kidney pie.

HOT PIE: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.

BRIENNE: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.

HOT PIE: She weren't when I last spoke to her.

BRIENNE:  When was that?

HOT PIE: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry.

BRIENNE:  So what happened to her?

HOT PIE: Well--

BRIENNE: The quick version.

HOT PIE: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.

PODRICK: The Hound.

HOT PIE: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.

PODRICK hands a small bundle to BRIENNE. He exits. BRIENNE opens the bundle to reveal a bread shaped like a wolf.

BRIENNE:  Um, you were saying?

EXT. The King's Road

BRIENNE and PODRICK walk their horses down the road.

BRIENNE:  Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

PODRICK: The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun. They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

BRIENNE: Why the Eyrie?

PODRICK: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.

BRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.

PODRICK: Aye, my lady. Could be.

BRIENNE:  You sure about this?

PODRICK: No.

They continue through the woods.

INT. TYRION's cell, night.

TYRION sits in the dark, sadly. The door opens and OBERYN enters, bearing a torch..

TYRION: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

OBERYN: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

TYRION: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.

OBERYN puts down his torch and sits.

OBERYN: Your sister.

TYRION: Oh.

OBERYN:  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.

TYRION: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.

OBERYN: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.

TYRION: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.

OBERYN: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.

TYRION: I think I would have remembered that.

OBERYN: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.

TYRION: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.

OBERYN: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.

TYRION: That would have made things so much easier.

OBERYN: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, "Soon." Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. "That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby." And she said, "He killed my mother." And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. "It doesn't matter," she told us. "Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."

TYRION: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.

OBERYN: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.

TYRION: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.

OBERYN: I disagree.

OBERYN rises.

OBERYN: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.

EXT; The Aerie courtyard.

SANSA walks out to the courtyard. It is snowing. She builds a model of Winterfell from snow. ROBIN enters.

SANSA: Hello, Robin.

ROBIN: What are you doing?

SANSA: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.

ROBIN: Why did you leave?

SANSA: It's a long story.

ROBIN: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.

SANSA: Yes, you certainly are.

ROBIN: When will you go back?

SANSA: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.

ROBIN: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

SANSA: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.

ROBIN: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?

SANSA: We don't.

ROBIN: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?

SANSA: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.

ROBIN: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.

SANSA: I like the sound of that.

ROBIN: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

SANSA: All right.

ROBIN: It can go in here in this big tower.

ROBIN reaches to show her, and accidentally knocks down the snow tower.

SANSA: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.

ROBIN: I didn't ruin it.

SANSA: You did.

ROBIN: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.

SANSA: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.

ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!

SANSA: You're being stupid.

ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!

ROBIN, in a tantrum, kicks and smashes the snow castle. Shocked, SANSA slaps him. ROBIN exits, sobbing.

SANSA: Robin, I'm sorry, I--

LITTLEFINGER enters.

LITTLEFINGER: Children.

SANSA: I hit him.

LITTLEFINGER:  Yes, I saw.

SANSA: I shouldn't have done that.

LITTLEFINGER: No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.

SANSA: If he tells Aunt Lysa...

LITTLEFINGER: Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

SANSA: I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.

LITTLEFINGER: A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.

SANSA: Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.

LITTLEFINGER: I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.

LITTLEFINGER touches SANSA's hair.

LITTLEFINGER: You're more beautiful than she ever was.

SANSA: Lord Baelish...

LITTLEFINGER: Call me Petyr.

LITTLEFINGER kisses SANSA. Above them, LYSA has been watching, and she exits quickly.

INT. The Aerie throne room.

SANSA enters. LYSA stands looking out the moon door.

SANSA: You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

LYSA: Come here, Sansa.

SANSA joins her beside the moon door.

LYSA: Do you know how far the fall is?

SANSA: No.

LYSA: Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did.

SANSA: I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen--

LYSA: Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.

SANSA: I didn't. You don't understand.

LYSA grabs SANSA's forearm.

LYSA: I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.

SANSA:  He kissed me. I pulled away.

LYSA grabs SANSA's hair and forces her to lean over the moon door.

LYSA:  Liar! Whore! He is mine!

LYSA pushed SANSA onto her hands an knees.

SANSA: Please!

LYSA: My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!

LITTLEFINGER: Lysa! Let her go.

LYSA: You want her? This empty-headed child?

LITTLEFINGER: Let her go.

LYSA: She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?

LITTLEFINGER: I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.

LYSA cries. She pushes SANSA away from the moon door and begins weeping. LITTLEFINGER approaches her and hugs her.

LITTLEFINGER: Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.

LITTLEFINGER helps LYSA to stand.

LITTLEFINGER: I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.

LITTLEFINGER pushes LYSA through the moon door. She screams as she falls.
[Open to the dark, seedy town of Moles Town. Two men walk toward a brothel with smiles on their faces]

MAN 1: Here we are.

[Inside everyone is happy, drinking, enjoying themselves. One woman is burping a tune]

MAN 2: The Rains of Castamere!

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt.

[Everyone laughs and goes ooooo. She burps the same tune]

MAN 3: Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!

[Everyone cheers]

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?

GILLY: Yes.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Well, what are you going to say?

GILLY: I'm sorry it woke you up.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

GILLY: Don't you ever touch him.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?

GILLY: Shut your mouth.

MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.

GILLY: No it's not.

[The owl hoots again. A man walks toward a well and in the reflection it's seen that Styr sliced the mans throat. Tormund is also seen as the Wildlings walk through the town killing everyone. Ygritte is also there. Styr and the Wildlings break into the brothel, continuing their killing spree. Ygritte kills everyone upstairs, as she's leaving she hears Gilly's baby cry. Ygritte opens a drape in the back and motions them to keep quiet]

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

SAM: I should never have left her there.

JON: You couldn't have known.

SAM: Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.

GRENN: And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?

ED: Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.

GRENN: Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!

ED: I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.

GRENN: We pledged to guard the realms of men.

SAM: She's dead because of me.

GRENN: We can't even guard Mole's Town.

JON: We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.

SAM: Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.

PYP: Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did.

ED: She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.

SAM: She might have.

JON: If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.

ED: A hundred thousand.

GRENN: And there's what, 5 of us left.

ED: If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two.

PYP: How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?

ED: Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.

[Everyone takes a drink]

CUT TO: MEEREEN

[Men and women are seen swimming in a lake. They're bathing and washing clothes. Grey Worm looks over at Missandei who is naked. Missandei sees him looking, he looks away ashamed then looks back. She stands up proudly, then covers up. He dunks his head under water]

DANY: You think he was spying on you?

MISSANDEI: No, not spying.

DANY: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.

MISSANDEI: Yes your grace.

DANY: But you are not Dothraki.

MISSANDEI: No.

DANY: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.

MISSANDEI: He was interested.

DANY: What?

MISSANDEI: I believe he was interested.

DANY: When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?

MISSANDEI: All of it?

DANY: The...the pillar an the stones.

MISSANDEI: I don't know, your grace.

DANY: Haven't you ever wondered?

MISSANDEI: Yes, your grace.

[Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters]

GREY WORM: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.

MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.

GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.

MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* No.

GREY WORM: The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I.

MISSANDEI: To me.

GREY WORM: To me.

MISSANDEI: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.

GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.

MISSANDEI: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?

GREY WORM: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.

MISSANDEI: When they cut you, do you remember that?

[Grey Worm shakes his head no]

MISSANDEI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.

GREY WORM: Why? Why sorry?

MISSANDEI: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

GREY WORM: *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.

[Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away]

MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.

[Grey Worm stops and turns around]

MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.

GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* So am I.

[Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room]

CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN

RAMSAY: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?

THEON: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.

RAMSAY: And what are you really?

THEON: I'm Reek.

RAMSAY: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.

THEON: I'm Reek.

RAMSAY: Until when?

THEON: Always. Forever.

RAMSAY: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.

[Theon approaches the castle on horseback]

GUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?

[Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying]

RALF: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

THEON: Yes.

RALF: And why should I believe that?

THEON: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.

EVERYONE: What is dead may never die.

RALF: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?

THEON: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.

RALF: And what does Lord Bolton want?

[Theon hands Kenning a scroll]

THEON: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.

RALF: He wants us to surrender?

THEON: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.

[Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up]

RALF: ...shame fought with honor.

THEON: I'm sorry, I didn't hear...

[Kenning spits blood in Theon's face]

RALF: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?

THEON: *scared* You don't know.

RALF: The Ironborn will not surrender.

THEON: *whispering* Reek. Reek.

RALF: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?

[MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe]

THEON: Reek.

MAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?

THEON: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.

[Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out]

RAMSAY: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?

THEON: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?

RAMSAY: I believe we will. To our new home.

CUT TO: THE VALE

You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?

PETYR: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.

LORD ROYCE: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.

PETYR: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.

LORD ROYCE: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.

PETYR: My lord...

LORD ROYCE: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...

PETYR: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.

LADY ANYA: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.

PETYR: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

LADY ANYA: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.

LORD ROYCE: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

PETYR: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.

LORD ROYCE: We were told there was a witness. A girl.

LADY ANYA: A niece of yours, I believe.

PETYR: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.

LORD ROYCE: We'd like to speak with her.

PETYR: Let me fetch her.

LADY ANYA: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.

[Sansa Stark enters the room]

LADY ANYA: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.

PETYR: My lady...

LADY ANYA: I wasn't asking you.

SANSA: He can stay.

LORD ROYCE: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.

SANSA: *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.

LADY ANYA: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

SANSA: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.

LORD ROYCE: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

SANSA: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.

SER VANCE: Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

LORD ROYCE: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.

LADY ANYA: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

SANSA: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.

LORD ROYCE: Lady Sansa.

SANSA: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*

LADY ANYA: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.

[Sansa looks up at Petyr]

[Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs]

LORD ROYCE: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.

LADY ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

LORD ROYCE: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.

PETYR: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.

LADY ANYA: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?

PETYR: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

LORD ROYCE: Are you questioning our courage?

PETYR: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?

LORD ROYCE: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.

PETYR: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?

LADY ANYA: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.

PETYR: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.

LADY ANYA: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

PETYR: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.

LADY ANYA: More often they die young.

PETYR: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.

LORD ROYCE: Aye, it's time.

PETYR: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.

CUT TO: MEEREEN

BOY: Ser Barristan.

SER BARRISTAN: Yes? Who sent you?

[A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it]

[Ser Jorah is looking at a map by the water alone]

SER JORAH: Ser Barristan.

SER BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.

SER JORAH: Have I forgotten a council meeting?

SER BARRISTAN: No.

[Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll]

SER JORAH: What's this?

SER BARRISTAN: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.

SER JORAH: Who gave you this?

SER BARRISTAN: Does it matter?

SER JORAH: Have you told her?

SER BARRISTAN: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.

SER JORAH: Let me speak with her in private.

SER BARRISTAN: You'll never be alone with her again.

[Ser Barristan leaves]

[Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her]

DANY: Why did the usurper pardon you?

SER JORAH: If we could speak alone.

DANY: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.

SER JORAH: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.

DANY: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.

SER JORAH: It is not forged.

DANY: Why, then?

SER JORAH: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.

DANY: What was the content of these letters?

SER JORAH: Information.

DANY: What information?

SER JORAH: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.

DANY: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

SER JORAH: I...

DANY: Yes or no?

SER JORAH: Khaleesi.

DANY: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

SER JORAH: Yes.

DANY: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.

SER JORAH: I stopped you from drinking his wine.

DANY: Because you knew it was poisoned.

SER JORAH: I suspected.

DANY: You betrayed me from the first.

SER JORAH: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

DANY: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...

SER JORAH: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.

DANY: ...and you want me to forgive you?

SER JORAH: I have loved you.

DANY: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.

SER JORAH: Daenerys, please.

[Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand]

DANY: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.

[Ser Jorah rides away from Mereen]

CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN

[Ramsay is seen holding a flag out to Lord Bolton]

RAMSAY: Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

LORD BOLTON: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?

RAMSAY: No.

RAMSAY: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.

RAMSAY: Moors, fields, hills.

RAMSAY: Tell me what you see.

RAMSAY: Nothing.

ROOSE: Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?

RAMSAY: Ramsay Snow.

ROOSE: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

RAMSAY: You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.

[The Bolton army rides forward on horseback]

RAMSAY: Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

CUT TO: THE VALE

[Sansa is seen sitting on her bed sewing. Petyr knocks on her door]

SANSA: Yes?

PETYR: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?

SANSA: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

PETYR: That's not an answer.

SANSA: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?

PETYR: I don't know.

SANSA: Neither do I.

PETYR: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?

SANSA: I know what you want.

PETYR: Do you?

[She looks up at him]

CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE VALE

[Arya and the Hound approach the Vale]

HOUND: I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.

ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.

HOUND: Like what?

ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

HOUND: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?

ARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.

HOUND: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

ARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?

HOUND: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.

ARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.

HOUND: *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*

ARYA: You should have let me burn it.

HOUND: It's a fleabite.

ARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.

HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk too much further.

ARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?

HOUND: Aye, she'll pay.

ARYA: I've never even met her.

HOUND: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.

ARYA: I'm not a lady.

GUARD: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

HOUND: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

GUARD: Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.

[Arya bursts out laughing]

CUT TO: THE VALE

[Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin]

ROBIN: I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

PETYR: You shouldn't be.

ROBIN: The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.

PETYR: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.

[Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her]

SANSA: Shall we go?

CUT TO: KING'S LANDING

[In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime]

TYRION: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?

JAIME: Soon.

TYRION: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?

JAIME: I've never seen him fight.

TYRION: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

JAIME: Oberyn believes in himself.

TYRION: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?

JAIME: Beheading.

TYRION: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.

JAIME: Cousins.

TYRION: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?

JAIME: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.

TYRION: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.

TOGETHER: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!

TYRION: Nothing made him happier.

JAIME: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.

TYRION: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.

JAIME: The joke wore thin, though.

TYRION: For you. You drifted away.

JAIME: I had other interests.

TYRION: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.

JAIME: Why?

TYRION: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer. "Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

JAIME: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

TYRION: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of "khuu, khuu, khuu". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard "khuu, khuu, khuu" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.

JAIME: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?

TYRION: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.

JAIME: He was twice your size.

TYRION: He just pushed me aside with a "khuu" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?

JAIME: I don't know.

[Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave]

JAIME: Good luck today.

[Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs]

TYRION: Looks like very light armor.

OBERYN: I like to move around.

TYRION: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.

OBERYN: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.

TYRION: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

OBERYN: Today is not the day I die.

ELLARIA: You're going to fight that?

OBERYN: I'm going to kill that.

ELLARIA: He is the biggest man I've ever seen.

OBERYN: Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.

TYRION: Thank the gods.

PYCELL: In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...

[Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria]

ELLARIA: Don't leave me alone in this world.

OBERYN: Never.

[Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers]

OBERYN: Have they told you who I am?

MOUNTAIN: Some dead man.

[The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins]

OBERYN: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.

OBERYN: I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.

OBERYN: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.

OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!

[Oberyn stabs the Mountain in the gut]

OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her!

[Oberyn charges at the Mountain to give him one final blow]

OBERYN: You killed her children!

[Everyone looks down, surprised. Oberyn pulls his weapon out of the Mountain and starts walking around his body]

OBERYN: Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!

[The Mountain trips Oberyn and grabs him in his massive hands. He punches out his teeth and gets on top of Oberyn, squeezing his head]

MOUNTAIN: Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!

[Ellaria screams in agony. Tyrion looks dead inside]

TYWEN: *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.
[Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night]

SAM: What was she like?

JON: She...she had red hair.

SAM: Oh? How big were her feet?

JON: Well what do you want me to say?

SAM: I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.

JON: So you and Gilly never-

SAM: No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.

JON: But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?

SAM: The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.

JON: What?

SAM: "I shall take no wife" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. "I shall father no children" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.

JON: I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.

SAM: Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?

JON: It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!

SAM: No, you're really not.

JON: And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.

SAM: There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.

JON: There will.

SAM: They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.

JON: Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.

[Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background]

TORMUND: Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?

YGRITTE: Yes.

TORMUND: Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--

YGRITTE: I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.

TORMUND: We could be waiting here a while.

YGRITTE: Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.

STYR: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.

YGRITTE: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.

STYR: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.

YGRITTE: I probably killed him already.

STYR: So you've said.

YGRITTE: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.

STYR: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

[Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr]

YGRITTE: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?

STYR: Maybe I have.

YGRITTE: Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.

[Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading]

AEMON: And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?

SAM: Maester Aemon. How did you know-

AEMON: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?

SAM: Let me help you.

AEMON: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?

SAM: Maester Faull

AEMON: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.

SAM: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.

AEMON: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.

SAM: I don't love her.

AEMON: Yes you do.

SAM: No.

AEMON: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.

SAM: You were?

AEMON: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?

SAM: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.

AEMON: You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.

SAM: Who was she?

AEMON: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.

[Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar]

PYP: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!

GILLY: They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!

PYP: I'm sorry, I can't.

GILLY: If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.

SAM: Pyp! Open the gate.

PYP: I can't.

GILLY: Sam, is that you?!

SAM: Yes!

PYP: Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.

SAM: Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!

[Pyp goes to open the gate]

PYP: I've never heard you curse before.

SAM: Yes, well, best get used to it.

[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her]

SAM: Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.

GILLY: It was horrible.

SAM: I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.

GILLY: Don't let them send me away, Sam.

SAM: Never.

GILLY: I know there's no women allowed.

SAM: Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.

[A horn sounds in the distance]

ALLISER: Get ready!

[Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal]

THENN WARG: It's time.

[The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall]

JANOS: Pick up the pace!

[The barrels are rolled into place]

JON: There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

ALLISER: A hundred thousand you say?

JON: Yes sir.

ALLISER: You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.

JON: It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.

ALLISER: Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.

[Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something]

SAM: You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.

GILLY: You're leaving me again?

SAM: I'm not leaving you!

GILLY: You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.

SAM: I...I didn't mean in the same room.

GILLY: What are you going to do out there?

SAM: Help my brothers.

GILLY: How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.

SAM: I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.

GILLY: Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.

SAM: Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.

[Sam kisses Gilly]

GILLY: Promise me you won't die.

SAM: I promise you I won't die.

[Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared]

SAM: There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.

PYP: I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?

SAM: Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.

PYP: Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?

SAM: I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.

PYP: But you're afraid now?

SAM: Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.

[Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings]

YGRITTE: Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.

STYR: How high are the walls?

YGRITTE: Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.

TORMUND: Let's kill some Crows!

[Everyone cheers]

TORMUND: *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*

[The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe]

ALLISER: Archers knock, everyone else hold.

[The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel]

ALLISER: I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!

NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!

ALLISER: Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!

NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!

ALLISER: You all plan to die here tonight?

NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!

ALLISER: That's very good to hear. Draw!

MEMBER 1: Help, down below.

[Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch]

JANOS: They're attacking the southern gates!

ALLISER: Now?

JANOS: Now!

ALLISER: I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.

JANOS: What?!

ALLISER: What are you fucking waiting for, loose!

JANOS: You heard the man. Loose!

[The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows]

TORMUND: You, over there.

[Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops]

SAM: Did you get one?

PYP: No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.

SAM: Yeah?

PYP: I think we're gonna die.

SAM: If you keep missing we will.

[Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch]

ALLISER: Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?

NIGHT'S WATCH: No!

ALLISER: Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.

[Night's Watch cheers]

ALLISER: The Night's Watch will stand.

[Night's Watch cheers]

ALLISER: With me now! Now, with me!

[Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate. Pyp and Sam leave their position as Tormund scales the gate. On the other side Rayder's troops advance]

JANOS: No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.

JON: We can't just let them attack the gate!

JANOS: The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.

JON: Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?

JANOS: No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.

GRENN: Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.

JANOS: Needed below? Yes. Yes.

[Janos runs away. Jon and Grenn nod at each other]

JON: Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!

[The archers let loose a bunch of arrows at Rayder's men as they rush the wall and begin to climb]

JON: They won't summit before dawn.

GRENN: How do you know that?

JON: Because I've made that claim.

ED: I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.

[Archers of the Night's Watch are lowered perpendicular to The Wall]

JON: Knock! Draw! Loose!

[A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully. A giant stands next to him and shoots his own arrow up. The first rips through one of the posts. The second clears one of the Night's Watch straight off the wall. At Castle Black the fighting continues. Styr kills a man, the blood splatters on Olly's face. Janos comes down off the lift and Olly returns the lift to the top. Wildlings break into the kitchen. Janos cowardly runs down a hall toward where Gilly and her baby are hiding. He looks at her in shock. Outside Pyp finally hits someone with his crossbow.]

PYP: I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.

SAM: Oh, is it over?

PYP: Huh?

SAM: Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*

[Pyp goes up to shoot a Wildling, but Ygrytte shoots an arrow right through his neck. He falls into Sam's arms]

SAM: You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.

JON: Now!

ED: Now!

[The Night's Watch drop barrels down toward the Wildlings that approach the gate. Two giants and a mammoth approach the gate and begin pulling at it with long ropes]

JON: *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.

GRENN: Alright.

JON: *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...

GRENN: They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!

JON: Oil!

ED: Oil on the ramp!

ALLISER: Protect the gate!

[Alliser and Tormund start fighting each other like badasses. Tormund slices Alliser in the gut. Alliser falls to the ground and gets dragged  underneath]

ALLISER: Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!

[Sam sits with Pyp on his lap, dead. He lays him on the ground and grabs the crossbow. He makes a run for the lift as Thenn warg sees him and chases after him. Sam shoots him in the head with his crossbow. Grenn and the men that came down with him get off the lift]

SAM: *to Grenn* We need more men down here.

GRENN: We have to hold the gate.

SAM: But we need men here.

GRENN: Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!

[Sam gets in the lift]

SAM: *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!

[Olly sits on the ground with his hands over his ears in fear]

SAM: Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?

[Olly raises the lift]

SAM: And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!

[Olly looks down at a bow and arrow. On The Wall, barrels of flaming oil are dropped down on the giants and the mammoth. The mammoth goes running off and one of the giants chases after it. Up top, one of the barrels got stuck and the men of the Night's Watch frantically try to get it off the ramp. A spear is fired down at one of the giants and it hits him right in the back. The other giant shouts in anger and goes to raise the gate with his bare hands. The barrel explodes on the ramp. Sam approaches Jon]

JON: What are you doing up here?

SAM: The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.

JON: Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.

[Jon leaves his post and grabs his sword]

JON: Two brothers now fight with me.

ED: Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!

[Grenn gets to the inner gate with his men as the giant continues to raise the gate]

DONNEL: How are we gonna stop that?

COOPER: We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.

GRENN: You heard Jon, we hold the gate.

DONNEL: Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.

GRENN: We hold the gate!

[The giant lifts the gate and goes under it]

DONNEL: Mother save me. Father save me.

GRENN: The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?

DONNEL: No, please.

[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight]

GRENN: Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns

All TOGETHER: And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!

[Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom]

JON: *to Sam* I don't want you out there.

SAM: You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.

[Jon hands Sam a key]

JON: I need him more than I need you.

[Sam nods as Jon opens the lift door early and leaps out and begins fighting. So begins the most incredible shot in the series, as the camera pans around the entire battlefield showing us glimpses of this truly epic battle. Sam runs to a door and unlocks it]

SAM: We need you boy.

[Ghost runs out and attacks one of the men that Jon was fighting. Tormund gets his first arrow to the back. Styr sees Jon and rushes to fight him. They go at it for a bit. Ygritte runs out of arrows so she jumps down and steals some from a dead body. Styr and Jon are still fighting as Ygritte finally spots Jon. Styr slams Jon's face against an anvil. Jon kills Styr with a hammer. As he turns around he sees Yrgitte with an arrow aimed right at him. They both stare, Jon smiles. An arrow goes straight through Ygritte's chest. She falls to the ground. It was Olly, that bastard. Jon rushes to catch Ygritte]

YGRITTE: Jon Snow.

JON: No, shh, don't talk.

YGRITTE: Do you remember that cave?

[Jon nods]

YGRITTE: We should've stayed in that cave.

JON: We'll go back there.

YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.

[Ygritte dies. The battle rages on as Jon holds Ygritte's dead body. On the other side, Rayder's troops are climbing the wall]

ED: Drop the scythe, boys!

[A massive scythe drops down on the men]

ED: Hoister up!

[Rayder's troops retreat]

ED: They've had enough for one night.

[The Night's Watch cheers in excitement]

ED: Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.

[Inside Castle Black's walls Tormund is still alive, swinging his sword with two arrows in his back]

JON: Tormund. It's over, let it end.

TORMuND: This is how a man ends.

[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon]

JON: Put him in chains. We'll question him later.

TORMUND: I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!

JON: Aye, you should've.

[Gilly hears someone entering her room. She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door]

SAM: Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?

[Sam turns around and sees Janos. Outside the Night's Watch clean up after the battle. Sam and Jon descend the stairs]

SAM: We held them off.

JON: For one night.

SAM: This is a great victory.

JON: Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.

SAM: Where are you going?

JON: I'm going to find Mance.

SAM: To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.

JON: Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.

SAM: Without Mance? You're going to kill him?

JON: I'm going to try.

SAM: They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.

JON: He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.

SAM: He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!

JON: You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?

[Jon stands there for a second as he and Sam look at each other, then he walks off, Sam scampering after him. They walk down the tunnel toward the gate. The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground]

JON: They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

[Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword]

SAM: What are you doing?

JON: I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.

SAM: Jon. Come back.

[The gate raises and Jon walks through it]
[Jon Snow leaves the tunnel and walks out into the snow. Smoking dead bodies lie all around him. As he walks into the forest he becomes surrounded by Wildlings. He has entered the Wildling camp unarmed]

MANCE: You're wearing a black cloak again.

JON: I've been sent to negotiate with you.

[Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat]

MANCE: It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.

JON: The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

MANCE: All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?

JON: She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

MANCE: Did you see her again at Castle Black?

JON: Yes.

MANCE: And?

JON: She's dead.

MANCE: Your doing?

JON: No.

MANCE: We'll drink to her.

[One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance]

MANCE: Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.

[They pick up their cups]

MANCE: Ygritte.

JON: Ygritte.

[They take a sip and Jon begins to cough]

JON: That's not wine.

MANCE: No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.

JON: He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.

MANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.

JON: Grenn came from a farm.

[They lift their cups]

MANCE: Mag and Grenn.

JON: Grenn and Mag.

MANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?

JON: Turn your army around and go home.

MANCE: You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?

JON: I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.

MANCE: I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.

[Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready]

MANCE: Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?

[A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck]

MANCE: You attacking us?

JON: No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.

[The Wildlings run around frantically. Men on horseback ride toward them]

MANCE: Hold! To me. To me.

[The horsemen continue toward the Wildlings, killing all in their path. The Wildlings fight back, clearly outnumbered]

MANCE: Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.

[Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself]

STANNIS: You're the king beyond the wall?

[Mance nods]

STANNIS: You know who I am?

MANCE: Never had the pleasure.

DAVOS: This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.

MANCE: We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.

STANNIS: It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

MANCE: We do not kneel.

STANNIS: I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.

MANCE: All the same, we do not kneel.

STANNIS: Take these men away.

DAVOS: What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?

JON: I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.

DAVOS: You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.

JON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.

STANNIS: Your father was an honorable man.

JON: He was, your grace.

STANNIS: What do you think he'd have done with him?

JON: I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.

STANNIS: Very well. *to Davos* Take him.

JON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.

CUT TO: KING'S LANDING

[Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei]

PYCELLE: I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.

CERSEI: Bloody Martells.

PYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.

QYBURN: It is, yes, manticore.

PYCELLE: I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.

QYBURN: Yes there is.

PYCELLE: May I ask what you think you're doing?

QYBURN: Saving him.

PYCELLE: Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.

QYBURN: That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.

PYCELLE: That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.

CERSEI: You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

PYCELLE: Your grace. This is my laboratory!

CERSEI: Not anymore.

[Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body]

CERSEI: You can save him?

QYBURN: Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.

CERSEI: Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.

QYBURN: Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.

CERSEI: Will it weaken him?

QYBURN: Oh no.

CERSEI: Very well then.

[Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin]

TYWIN: Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.

CERSEI: I'm opening it again.

TYWIN: You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

CERSEI: I will not.

TYWIN: Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.

CERSEI: I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.

TYWIN: When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-

CERSEI: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.

TYWIN: Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

CERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.

TYWIN: No.

CERSEI: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.

TYWIN: And how will you do that?

CERSEI: I'll tell everyone the truth.

TYWIN: And what truth would that be?

CERSEI: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.

TYWIN: Known what?

CERSEI: Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.

TYWIN: No, no, no, no, no.

CERSEI: Your legacy is a lie.

TYWIN: I don't believe you.

CERSEI: Yes you do.

[Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room]

CERSEI: Jaime.

JAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?

CERSEI: For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.

JAIME: Tyrion is your family.

CERSEI: He's not.

JAIME: You don't get to choose.

CERSEI: I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-

JAIME: Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

CERSEI: A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?

JAIME: The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-

[Cersei kisses Jaime]

CERSEI: I choose you.

JAIME: Those are words.

CERSEI: Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.

JAIME: Told him what?

CERSEI: I told him about us.

JAIME: You told him?

CERSEI: I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.

JAIME: You think he'll just accept that?

CERSEI: Go and ask him.

[Cersei kisses Jaime]

JAIME: What did you say?

CERSEI: I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.

[Cersei kisses Jaime's metal hand. Jaime pulls her close and kisses her]

JAIME: Someone will walk in.

CERSEI: I don't care.

[Jaime picks Cersei up and lays her on the table as the start having sex.]

CUT TO: MEREEN

[Daenerys is sitting on her throne listening to her people's problems]

MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

FENNESZ: *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

DAENERYS: You speak it very well.

FENNESZ: Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.

DAENERYS: I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?

FENNESZ: When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets.

DAENERYS: I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

FENNESZ: I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

DAENERYS: My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.

FENNESZ: Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.

DAENERYS: What is it that you want from me?

FENNESZ: Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

DAENERYS: You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?

FENNESZ: Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-

DAENERYS: I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.

FENNESZ: Thank you, your grace. Thank you.

[Fennesz leaves slowly]

BARRISTAN: The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

[Another man enters the hall]

DAENERYS: Approach my friend.

MAN: *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen.

MISSANDEI: *in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.

MAN: *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*

MISSANDEI: *translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...

[The man kneels on the ground sobbing, laying a pile of burnt bones on the ground]

MISSANDEI: *translating* My girl. My little girl.

[The man continues to sob. In another room Daenerys is speaking with Missandei]

DAENERYS: What was her name?

MISSANDEI: Zala, your grace.

DAENERYS: How old was she?

MISSANDEI: Three.

DAENERYS: Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?

GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then.

DAENERYS: *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.

[The entrance to the catacombs is rolled open. Daenerys' dragons enter followed by Daenerys. Inside there is food for them. They chomp at the food as Daenerys puts a chain collar around their necks. She walks away crying as they screech at her. She turns around as the catacombs close with tears in her eyes.]

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

[Aemon and the rest of the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their fallen comrades]

AEMON: They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.

ALL TOGETHER: And now their watch is ended.

AEMON: And now their watch is ended.

Aemon passes the torch around as each member of the Night's Watch helps burn the bodies. Stannis watches from above. [Jon Snow and Melisandre share a look]

TORMUND: Your old blind man patched me up. Why?

JON: He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.

TORMUND: You want me alive so you can torture me?

JON: No one's going to torture you.

TORMUND: So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?

JON: I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

TORMUND: Who decides?

JON: I suppose Stannis does.

TORMUND: He your king now?

JON: I don't have a king.

TORMUND: You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.

JON: We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?

TORMUND: Words? What kind of words?

JON: Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.

TORMUND: Do what?

JON: Say farewell.

TORMUND: The dead can't hear us, boy.

[Jon walks away]

TORMUND: Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.

JON: She told you?

TORMUND: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?

[Jon leaves and takes Ygritte's body out past The Wall. He burns her body in a pile of logs.]

CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL

[Hodor drags Bran through the snow followed by Jojen and Meera Reed]

MEERA: We can stop, we can rest.

JOJEN: We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

[Jojen falls to the ground]

MEERA: We're not going to make it.

JOJEN: We're already here.

BRAN: Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look.

[The group stands at the edge of a cliff. A large tree is seen  not too far off in the distance. They head toward it. As they walk a skeleton hand reaches up and drags Jojen to the ground. It starts pulling him backwards as Meera runs towards him]

MEERA: JOJEN! Hold on!

BRAN (to Hodor): Help them! Now!

MEERA: Hold on to me!

[More hands burst from the ground.]

HODOR: Hodor...

BRAN: Help them!

[Skeleton warriors have now emerged from the ground. They attack Jojen, Meera and Hodor. A brawl ensues. One of them attacks Bran until his direwolf, Summer, fights it off. Bran then wargs into Hodor and starts fighting back.]

JOJEN: Bran! Save yourself, now!

[Meera defeats a skeleton warrior, only to see another repeatedly stabbing Jojen. Just as two skeletons close in on the warging Bran, theyre destroyed by two fireballs, apparently controlled by a young girl.]

GIRL: Come with me, Brandon Stark!

[She looks at Meera and Jojen.]
GIRL: He is lost. Come with me, or die with him.

[JOJEN: Go with them.

The girl throws some more fireballs and the group move into a cave. When the skeletons try to follow, they explode.]

GIRL: They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.

BRAN: Who are you?

GIRL: The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you.

[They enter a room filled with tree roots. An old man is seated in the center. Bran approaches him.]

BRAN: Youre the three-eyed raven.

OLD MAN: I have been many things. Now, I am what you see.

MEERA: My brother, he led us to you, and now he

OLD MAN: He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway.

MEERA: How do you know?

OLD MAN: Ive been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now youve come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.

BRAN: I didnt want anyone to die for me.

OLD MAN: He died so that you could find what you have lost.

BRAN: Youre going to help me walk again?

OLD MAN: Youll never walk again. But you will fly.

CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS

[Brienne and Podrick wake up in the open air on their way to the Eyrie.]

BRIENNE: Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?

PODRICK: I hobbled them last night.

BRIENNE: What sort of hobble?

PODRICK: A figure-eight, like you taught me.

BRIENNE: If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.

PODRICK: Thieves, maybe?

BRIENNE: Its at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. Youre carrying the saddle bags.

[Brienne sees Arya Stark practising her river-dancing.]

ARYA: People coming. You can shit later, theres people coming!

BRIENNE: Morning!

ARYA: Morning.

BRIENNE: I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?

ARYA: About ten more miles.

BRIENNE: Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.

ARYA: Are you a knight?

BRIENNE: No.

ARYA: But you know how to use that sword.

BRIENNE: I do.

ARYA: Does it have a name?

BRIENNE: Oathkeeper.

ARYA: Mines Needle.

BRIENNE: Good name.

ARYA: Who taught you how to fight?
BRIENNE: My father.

ARYA: Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.

BRIENNE: Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, If youre going to do it, you might as well do it right.

[Sandor The Hound Clegane emerges.]

BRIENNE: Seven blessings. Im Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne.

HOUND: You want something?

PODRICK: Thats Sandor Clegane- the Hound.

BRIENNE: Youre Arya Stark.

HOUND: I asked if you wanted something.

BRIENNE: I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.

ARYA: My mothers dead.

BRIENNE: I know. I wish I couldve been there to protect her.

ARYA: Youre not a northerner.

BRIENNE: I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

ARYA: Why didnt you?

BRIENNE: She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to Kings Landing.

HOUND: Youre paid by the Lannisters. Youre here for the bounty on me.

BRIENNE: Im not paid by the Lannisters.

HOUND: No? Fancy sword youve got there. Whered you get it? Ive been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me thats not Lannister gold.

BRIENNE: Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

ARYA: The Bloody Gates ten miles.

BRIENNE: I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -

ARYA: I dont care what you swore!

BRIENNE: Arya!

HOUND: You heard the girl! Shes not coming with you.

BRIENNE: She is.

[Brienne and The Hound both draw their swords.]

HOUND: Youre not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- Ive always wanted some Valyrian steel.

BRIENNE: Come with me Arya. Ill take you to safety.

HOUND: Safety?! Where the fucks that? Her aunt in the Eyries dead. Her mothers dead, her fathers dead, her brothers dead. Winterfells a pile of rubble. Theres no safety, you dumb bitch. If you dont know that by now, youre the wrong one to watch over her.

BRIENNE: And thats what youre doing? Watching over her?

HOUND: Aye, thats what Im doing.

[They begin a swordfight. The Hound seems to have the upper hand but Brienne defends well and floors him.]

BRIENNE: I have no wish to kill you Ser.

[The Hound grabs Briennes blade with his palms, shoves it to one side and punches her.]

HOUND: Im not a knight.

[They fight bare-handed, Brienne bites off The Hound's ear, then The Hound draws a knife, and Brienne grabs a rock. She pushes The Hound down a steep cliff.]

BRIENNE: Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?

PODRICK: She was just here...

BRIENNE: Why werent you watching her?

PODRICK: I was watching you I thought you migth need some help

BRIENNE: Which way Pod? Which way did she go?

PODRICK: Ah, I think that way.

BRIENNE: Arya!

[The camera moves to show us Arya hiding just above Brienne. She walks down to The Hound.]

HOUND: Youre still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.

ARYA: I dont need saving.

HOUND: No, not you. Youre a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle.

ARYA: Youre gonna die?

HOUND: Unless theres a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, Im done. Id skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. Shell help you. Going out alone, you wont last a day out there.

ARYA: Ill last longer than you.

HOUND: You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. Im ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butchers boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please dont kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butchers boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I shouldve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I shouldve fucked her bloody. At least Id have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.

[Arya stands up, takes The Hounds coin purse, and walks away.]

HOUND: Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

CUT TO: KING'S LANDING

[We enter Tyrions cell. The door opens.]

TYRION: Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.

JAIME: Is that any way to speak about our mother?

TYRION: Whatre you doing?

JAIME: What do you think Im doing? The galleys waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

TYRION: Whos helping you?

JAIME: Varys.

TYRION: Varys?

JAIME: You have more friends than you thought.

[They reach the end of the underground tunnel.]

JAIME: Theres a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.

TYRION: I suppose this is goodbye, then.

[They hug.]

JAIME: Farewell, little brother.

TYRION: Jaime, thank you. For my life.

JAIME: Quickly now.

[Tyrion takes a torch and uses a trap door to enter a room. There is a woman sleeping on a double bed, and we see the booch of the Hand of the King.]

WOMAN: Tywin my lion...

[We see that the woman is Shae. She grabs a knife, and she and Tyrion struggle. Tyrion eventually strangles her with the bedclothes, weeping.]

TYRION: Im sorry. Im sorry.

[Tyrion takes a crossbow from the wall and walks in on Tywin on the privy.]

TYWIN: Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, well go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure

TYRION: All my life, youve wanted me dead.

TYWIN: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for whats yours. Id never let them execute you; is that what you fear? Id never let Illyn Payne take your head. Youre a Lannister. Youre my son.

TYRION: I loved her.

TYWIN: Who?

TYRION: Shae.

TYWIN: Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.

TYRION: I murdered her. With my own hands.

TYWIN: It doesnt matter.

TYRION: It doesnt matter?

TYWIN: She was a whore!

TYRION: Say that word again.

TYWIN: And what? Youll kill your own father in the privy? No. Youre my son. Enough of this nonsense

TYRION: I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didnt poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?

TYWIN: Enough. Well go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.

TYRION: I cant go back there. Shes in there.

TYWIN: What, are you afraid of a dead whore?

[Tyrion fires the crossbow at Tywin.]

TYWIN: You shot me. Youre no son of mine.

TYRION: I am your son. I have always been your son.

[Tyrion fires again.]

VARYS: What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, Ive brought you this far.

[Varys loads Tyrion, in a transport container, onto a ship. He goes to walk back to King's Landing, but turns around and boards the ship himself]

CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS

[We go back to Arya, alone. She rides her horse to a small port.]

ARYA: I want to see the captain.

CAPTAIN: Youre seeing him.

ARYA: I want to go north, to the wall.

CAPTAIN: No you dont.

ARYA: I can pay.

CAPTAIN: There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.

ARYA: I wouldnt need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or

CAPTAIN: Im not going north, child, were going home.

ARYA: Wheres home?

CAPTAIN: The Free City of Braavos.

ARYA: Wait, I have something else.

CAPTAIN: More silver wont make a difference.

ARYA: Its not silver, its iron.

[Arya hands over the token she was given by Jaqen H'ghar.]

ARYA: Valar morghulis.

CAPTAIN: How did you valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.

[We see Arya aboard the ship.]





TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT. WOODS

A younger Cersei and her friend Melara are walking in the woods.

MELARA: We shouldnt be out here alone.

CERSEI: Why not?

MELARA: If your father hears

CERSEI: Hell never know weve been gone.

MELARA: But if he finds out

Cersei takes her hands.

CERSEI: You dont need to be afraid of my father.

They walk until they see a hut with smoke coming out of it.

MELARA: Are you sure?

CERSEI: Yes.

MELARA: We shouldnt go in.

CERSEI: Of course we should.

INT. MAGGYS HUT

A fire is burning and various plants are hanging from the ceiling. They hear a shriek then

MAGGY: Get out. Get out!

MELARA: Lets go

CERSEI: No.

MAGGY: Listen to your friend.

CERSEI: They said that you were terrifying. With cats teeth and three eyes. Youre not terrifying. Youre boring.

MAGGY: You dont know what I am.

CERSEI: I know youre a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.

MAGGY: Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.

CERSEI: This is my fathers land. My land. Tell me my future or Ill have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.

Maggy chuckles then hands Cersei a knife.

MAGGY: Your blood. Give me a taste.

Cersei cuts her thumb then Maggy grabs her hand to suck her blood.

MAGGY: Three questions you get. You wont like the answers.

CERSEI: Ive been promised to the prince. When will we marry?

MAGGY: Youll never wed the prince. Youll wed the king.

CERSEI: But I will be queen?

MAGGY: Oh yes, youll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

CERSEI: Will the king and I have children?

MAGGY: No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.

CERSEI: That doesnt make sense.

MAGGY: Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.

Maggy starts laughing. Cerseis thumb starts dripping blood.

MELARA: Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!

CUT TO: CERSEIS FACE - KINGS LANDING - MODERN DAY

Cersei gets out of a cart to a funeral procession outside of the Great Sept of Baelor. She walks to the top of the stairs.

PRIEST: Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting.

CERSEI: They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.

PRIEST: But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here

Cersei starts walking away.

PRIEST: From all seven kingdoms

CERSEI: They will wait.

INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

Tywins body rests with hand-painted stones on top of his eyes. Jaime presides over the body. Cersei walks next to him.

CERSEI: He never wanted you to be a Kings Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.

JAIME: What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. Theyre going to try to take it away, all of it.

CERSEI: They?

JAIME: All of them out there are enemies. Theyre waiting a night to make sure hes really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes theyll set to work on tearing us apart.

CERSEI: They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, hes the enemy. Ive been telling you for years, youve been defending him for years

JAIME: This is exactly what they want.

CERSEI: ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?

No response from Jaime.

CERSEI: Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. Youre a man of action, arent you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.

Cersei kisses Tywin on the head then leaves.

INT. CRATE - PENTOS

We see men working with rope, merchants carrying boxes, and trees through a hole in the crate. The crate is set down and opened up. Tyrion comes out with Varys standing over him.

VARYS: Apologies.

TYRION: I still dont see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.

VARYS: I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate.

TYRION: Do you know what its like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?

VARYS: No. I only know what its like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

Tyrion looks around.

TYRION: Pentos?

Varys nods.

VARYS: The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

Tyrion pours himself a cup of wine and drinks it.

TYRION: Much better.

VARYS: My lord?

TYRION: I dont think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I dont suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.

VARYS: You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.

TYRION: In a box. Why stop now?

VARYS: Because we are talking about the future of our country.

Tyrion finishes his wine.

TYRION: The future is shit. Just like the past.

He pukes up his wine and then pours himself another cup.

CUT TO: MEEREEN

The giant bronze Harpy statue is pulled down from the top of the pyramid.

EXT. BROTHEL - MEEREEN

An Unsullied soldier, White Rat, walks up to a prostitute and hands her a coin. She takes him into her room and starts undressing him.

PROSTITUTE: You want the same? Same as always?

She undresses herself

WHITE RAT: You you dont have to.

PROSTITUTE: Habit.

She puts her clothes back on and lays down next to him in bed, stroking his head and humming. A knife slits his throat. White Rat looks up and sees a member of the Sons of the Harpy holding the knife

INT. GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN

A golden Sons of the Harpy mask rests on the table.

DAENERYS: Sons of the Harpy?

BARRISTAN: Yes, your grace. They left it on the body.

DAENERYS: Theyve never killed before.

BARRISTAN: It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance.

DAENERYS: I didnt conquer them. Their own people did.

MOSSADOR: They do not see us as people, Your Grace.

DAENERYS: Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?

GREY WORM: White Rat, your grace.

DAENERYS: I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.

BARRISTAN: The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

MOSSADOR: Make them very angry.

DAENERYS: Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.

INT. HALLWAY

The Unsullied are putting their armor on. Missandei walks up to Grey Worm.

MISSANDEI: Torgo Nudho.

GREY WORM: Missandei hin Naath.

MISSANDEI: I wanted to speak with you.

The other Unsullied leave the room.

GREY WORM: Why do you come?

MISSANDEI: White Rat, the Unsullied who I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereens brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

GREY WORM: I do not know. I must go.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

Jon Snow is parrying with Olly. Jon puts his sword to Ollys neck.

JON: Get your shield up.

OLLY: Its too heavy.

JON: If it wasnt heavy it wouldnt stop a sword, now get it up.

Jon knocks Olly into the ground then helps him up.

JON: Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or Ill ring your head like a bell.

Sam and Gilly are watching them parry from afar.

GILLY: Shouldnt you be training, too?

SAM: Well, Im hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say theyve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!

Ser Alliser walks by.

ALLISER: These men need a firm hand. Always have. Theyre poachers and thieves.

He gives Sam and Gilly a look.

ALLISER: Not soldiers.

He walks away.

GILLY: That one hates me.

SAM: If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander he hates the wildlings.

Sam looks at Gillys baby.

SAM: All the wildlings.

GILLY: Dont let them send us away.

SAM: Its not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say hes a good man. Hes running against Ser Alliser--

GILLY: Sam! Dont let them send us away.

SAM: I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too.

GILLY: You cant leave, theyll execute you.

Cut back to Jon and Olly parrying. Olly is on the offensive.

JON: Good, good, pivot! Dont forget to pivot! Shield up!

Jon turns and sees Melisandre waiting.

MELISANDRE: The king wants a word.

INT. ELEVATOR - THE WALL

Jon looks uncomfortably at Melisandre.

JON: Youre not cold, my lady?

MELISANDRE: Never. The Lords fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

She takes his hand to her face.

MELISANDRE: Feel.

Jon feels her face.

MELISANDRE: Are you a virgin?

JON: No.

MELISANDRE: Good.

EXT. THE WALL

MELISANDRE: Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.

Jon bows to Stannis. Stannis motions for him to get up.

STANNIS: You know who rules at Winterfell now?

JON: Roose Bolton.

STANNIS: The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Starks heart. Dont you want to avenge him?

JON: I want a great many things, your grace. But Im a sworn brother of the Nights Watch now.

DAVOS: Ive been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.

JON: Theyre good men.

DAVOS: Many dont. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?

JON: Its where she belonged.

DAVOS: Some of the Nights Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.

JON: They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesnt make them monsters.

STANNIS: No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He cant protect them now. I shall mount Roose Boltons head on a spike. But if Im to take Winterfell Ill need more men.

JON: The men of the Nights Watch are sworn to play no part--

STANNIS: Im not talking about the damn Nights Watch. Im talking about the wildlings.

JON: Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?

STANNIS: If they swear to follow me, Ill pardon them. Well take Winterfell. Once the North is won, Ill declare them citizens of the realm. Ill give them land to live on.

DAVOS: Its a fair offer. More than fair.

STANNIS: Ill offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.

JON: I dont think thats likely.

STANNIS: You admire him, dont you?

JON: I respect him.

STANNIS: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...

JON: Your grace

STANNIS: ...or he burns.

JON: How much time do I have?

STANNIS: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow.

CUT TO: THE VALE OF ARRYN

Sansa, Littlefinger, and Yohn Royce are watching Robin parry. He is being beaten badly.

MASTER OF ARMS: Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Dont cross your feet!

YOHN ROYCE: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one

BAELISH: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.

ROYCE: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.

SQUIRE: My lord. (hands Baelish a note)

MASTER OF ARMS (O.S.): Sword up, my lord!

BAELISH: Some boys develop more slowly. Hes still young.

ROYCE: Hes 13. Boys go to war at 13.

BAELISH: He has other gifts.

ROYCE: Does he?

BAELISH: The gift of a great name. Sometimes thats all one needs.

He offers his hand to Sansa and takes her away from the swordfight. Lord Royce follows.

SANSA: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all youve done for me.

ROYCE: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.

BAELISH: I have no doubt that upon my return, Robins skills will have improved immeasurably.

ROYCE: Hell be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises.

CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE

Podrick sits down next to Brienne, who is sharpening her sword.

PODRICK: Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. Were a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--

BRIENNE: Us? The only reason youre here is that Jaime Lannister told me you werent safe in the capital. Youre hundreds of miles from Kings Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. Youre safe.

PODRICK: But Im youre squire.

BRIENNE: Do you even know what a squire is?

PODRICK: An attendant to a knight?

BRIENNE: Im not a knight. That means youre not a squire.

PODRICK: Well, where would I go?

BRIENNE: I dont care, Im not your mother.

PODRICK: You swore to find the Stark girls.

BRIENNE: I found Arya. She didnt want my protection.

PODRICK: Sansa still might.

BRIENNE: Will you shut your mouth? I didnt ask for advice. I dont want anyone following me. Im not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.

A horse and carriage rides by.

INT. CARRIAGE

SANSA: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.

BAELISH: I did.

SANSA: But were heading west.

BAELISH: We are.

SANSA: If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.

BAELISH: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but hes not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?

SANSA: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?

Baelish smiles.

BAELISH: No. But I pay them well, and theyve seen what happens to men who disappoint me.

SANSA: So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?

BAELISH: So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister cant get her hands on you.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

Close-up on Cersei drinking wine while Loras talks in the background.

LORAS: It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldnt presume to claim to have known him as such

Cut to Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.

LORAS: But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a what a force to be reckoned with.

CERSEI (sighs): Thank you so much for your kind words.

Cersei walks away and heads down the stairs.

GRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE: Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy I never trusted Varys. I often warned

Cersei walks away from him. A barefooted man in a robe walks up to Cersei.

LANCEL LANNISTER: Your grace.

Cersei inspects him for a moment.

CERSEI: Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

LANCEL: My deepest sympathies.

KEVAN LANNISTER: I apologize for my sons appearance.

CERSEI: Uncle, its quite alright.

Lancel walks away.

KEVAN: They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.

CERSEI: Im sure hell grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.

KEVAN: Of course.

Cersei walks away, grabs a glass of wine, and heads to a room alone. Lancel greets her after some time.

CERSEI: Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.

LANCEL: It wasnt my wounds that needed healing.

CERSEI: What can I do for you?

LANCEL: You can forgive me.

CERSEI: What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?

LANCEL: I led you into the darkness.

CERSEI: I doubt youve ever led anyone anywhere.

LANCEL: I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine.

CERSEI: I dont know what youre talking about.

LANCEL: Im a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your fathers soul.

Cersei laughs.

CERSEI: The day Tywin Lannisters soul needs your help

Cersei takes a sip of wine and Lancel walks away.

CUT TO: LORAS BEDROOM

Close-up of Loras' birth mark.

OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.

LORAS: No it doesnt.

OLYVAR: It does. Thats the Sunspear bit right there. And thats where the mountains are. And over here is Sunsnake? Stonespear?

LORAS: Sandstone.

OLYVAR: Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there.

LORAS: Fine.

They start kissing.

LORAS: Its Dorne.

OLYVAR: We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.

LORAS: Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here.

They kiss. Margaery walks in.

MARGAERY: Were late for dinner as it is.

LORAS: Youre very respectful.

MARGAERY: Im very hungry.

She closes the door.

MARGAERY: Whats your name?

OLYVAR: Olyvar, my lady.

MARGAERY: Im afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

Olyvar kisses Loras then leaves the room.

MARGAERY: Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?

LORAS: Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. Whats the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?

MARGAERY: In any event (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldnt keep your intended waiting.

LORAS: My intended? Please. Tywins dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.

MARGAERY: Lucky you.

LORAS: Unlucky you.

MARGAERY: You think I want that woman married to my brother?

LORAS: If she doesnt marry me, she doesnt go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in Kings Landing. Which means youre trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law.

MARGAERY: Perhaps.

LORAS: Perhaps?

MARGAERY: Perhaps?

CUT TO: PENTOS

Tyrion is standing on a balcony with a glass of wine. Varys approaches him.

TYRION: Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.

VARYS: Imp, half-man.

Tyrion raises his glass.

VARYS: There are faster ways to kill yourself.

TYRION: Not for a coward.

VARYS: You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.

TYRION: You never told me why you set me free.

VARYS: Your brother asked me to.

TYRION: You could have said no.

VARYS: Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.

TYRION: Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? Youre not family, you owe me nothing.

VARYS: I didnt do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

TYRION: A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

VARYS: I dont believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.

TYRION: Youre going to have to find another soldier. Im done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.

VARYS: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

TYRION: Im not well-suited for work.

VARYS: I think you are. You have your fathers instinct for politics, and you have compassion.

TYRION: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.

VARYS: I never said you were perfect.

TYRION: What is it you want exactly?

VARYS: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.

TYRION: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, thats how they became powerful in the first place.

VARYS: Perhaps. And perhaps weve grown so used to horror we assume theres no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?

TYRION: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

VARYS: No, you wont. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.

TYRION: Good luck finding him.

VARYS: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrios palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.

TYRION: Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

CUT TO: MEEREEN

The Unsullied march through the streets.

DAARIO NAHARIS: When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends havent been behaving themselves.

INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID

HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ: The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.

DAENERYS: Good.

HIZDAHR: They did ask for some concessions.

DAENERYS: Concessions?

HIZDAHR: Politics is the art of compromise, your grace.

DAENERYS: Im not a politician. Im a queen.

HIZDAHR: Forgive me. Youre right, of course. Still, its easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.

DAENERYS: I dont expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.

HIZDAHR: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.

DAENERYS: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

HIZDAHR: In the new world that youve brought to us, free men would fight free men.

Daario takes out his sword and smiles at Daenerys.

HIZDAHR: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.

DAENERYS: No fighting pits.

HIZDAHR: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.

DAENERYS: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

HIZDAHR: If you--

DAENERYS: How many times must I say no before you understand?

INT. GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM

DAENERYS: Whatever he wants from me hes not going to get it. If he really believes Im going to reopen the fighting pits

DAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.

DAENERYS: What?

DAARIO: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.

DAENERYS: Why?

DAARIO: I was a bad child. I wasnt big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.

DAENERYS: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and youre defending the fighting pits?

DAARIO: Im only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.

A long pause.

DAARIO: Youre the queen. Everyones too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. Youve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, theyll attack. Show your strength here, now.

DAENERYS: Thats why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.

DAARIO (scoffs): Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. Youre not the Mother of Unsullied. Youre the Mother of Dragons.

DAENERYS: I dont want another childs bones dropped at my feet. No ones seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know hes flown halfway across the world. I cant control them anymore.

DAARIO: A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.

INT. DRAGON PIT

Daenerys walks into the room the dragons are being held. She hears chains rattling.

DAENERYS: Viserion? Rhaegal?

The two fully grown dragons start snapping, screaming, and breathing fire at her.

DAENERYS: Easy. Easy. Easy.

They keep breathing fire and roaring so she leaves the room, terrified.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

Members of the Nights Watch are constructing a funeral pyre.

INT. MANCES CELL

Jon Snow enters the room.

MANCE: So here we are.

JON: Here we are.

MANCE: When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting

JON: This doesnt have to be our last meeting.

MANCE: No, but it will be.

JON: You know what Stannis wants?

MANCE: He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. Ill give him this much: hes bold.

JON: Shouldnt a king be bold?

MANCE: Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect hell be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But Ill never serve him.

JON: You told me you werent here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.

MANCE: Thats right. But I dont want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

JON: You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A lifes work uniting them. You didnt do it for power. You didnt do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if theyre north of the wall. Isnt their survival more important than your pride?

MANCE: Pride? Fuck my pride. This isnt about that.

JON: Then bend the knee and save your people.

MANCE: They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king thats all gone.

JON: And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you wont go out and rescue them because why? Youre afraid of looking afraid.

MANCE: Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?

JON: Theyll burn you alive.

MANCE: Bad way to go. Ill be honest with you, I dont want to die. And burnt to death, I dont want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But its better than betraying everything I believe.

JON: And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and theyll sing songs about you. Youd rather burn than kneel. The great hero. Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and theres no one left to sing.

MANCE: Youre a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you cant understand why I wont enlist my people in a foreigners war, theres no point explaining.

Jon walks to the door, then turns around.

JON: I think youre making a terrible mistake.

MANCE: The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.

Jon nods then leaves the room.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT

Members of the Nights Watch escort Mance to Stannis.

STANNIS: Mance Rayder, youve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.

Mance looks at the Free Folk, including Tormund, the Nights Watch have chained up. Then he looks at Jon Snow.

STANNIS: Kneel and live.

MANCE: This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

Stannis nods. His men take Mance onto the burning funeral pyre and tie him to it. Melisandre walks to the front of the pyre.

MELISANDRE: Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.

She picks up a torch.

MELISANDRE: Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.

She lights the pyre. Mance starts panicking as the fire reaches his legs. Jon Snow walks up to a high point and shoots Mance in the heart with an arrow, killing him.
Arya approaches the coast in the boat she boarded in the Season 4 finale. The Titan of Braavos looms over the ship.

BRAAVOSI MAN: In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

ARYA: He's just a statue.

A horn blows as they approach the statue. Arya clutches her chest and the man laughs.

MAN: Don't be afraid. Hes announcing our arrival.

ARYA: I'm not afraid.

Boat goes under statue

EXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR

Arya and the man are in a row boat. The man rows them to shore as they pass various street merchants. The man rows past them and The House of Black and White comes into view.

MAN: The House of Black and White: this is where you'll find the man you seek.

EXT. BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

They arrive at The House of Black and White

MAN: Here, I leave you.

He helps Arya get off the boat and onto the dock.

ARYA: Thank you for bringing me.

MAN: Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.

ARYA: Valar dohaeris.

Arya knocks on the door, twice; the door opens while knocking the second time. An old man enters

ARYA: Hello. Valar Morghulis.

The old man continues to stare; Arya takes out the coin.

ARYA: Jaqen Hghar gave me this.

OLD MAN: No one here by that name.

The old man is about to close the door before Arya interrupts.

ARYA: Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.

OLD MAN: You have everywhere else to go.

ARYA: But wait!

The Old Man shuts the door abruptly; Arya turns around and sits on the top step

EXT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - NIGHT

ARYA: Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.

Arya repeats the four names until the break of dawn as rain pours outside.

EXT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - DAY

ARYA: ...The Mountain, Meryn Trant.

Arya gets up and throws the coin into the sea

CUT TO: BRAAVOS

INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

Water drips down a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. Two more statues are shown, a lion sitting in a throne, and a rams head. Behind a large heart surrounded by gold flames, a glowing fire can be seen. A statue of a knight is shown, then a statue of a kings face. A statue of a contorted tree is covered in a hair-like substance. There is a large pit filled with liquid in the center of the room. Arya can be heard, and then seen, sweeping. The waif carries a bucket past her. Sitting on the edge of the pit, Jaqen whisper to a man. Arya looks up and watches as Jaqen scoops up a cup of liquid from the pit, and hands it to the man. The man looks up at Jaqen, and hesitates before taking it.

MAN: Valar morghulis.

JAQEN: Valar dohaeris.

The man drinks the liquid, and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen.

ARYA: I've been sweeping this floor for days.

JAQEN: Good.

ARYA: I didn't come here to sweep floors.

JAQEN: No? Why come, then?

ARYA: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.

JAQEN: A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away).

ARYA: I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).

JAQEN: A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.

ARYA: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.

JAQEN: There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.

Jaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back, dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the mans body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya.

ARYA: Where are they taking him?

The waif doesnt respond, but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

EXT. STREET

Bells are ringing, and people are cheering and shouting. Many are on the sides of the road, waving as a number of carriages are carried past.

BYSTANDERS: Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!

Inside her carriage, Cersei watches the people on the street, a sullen look on her face. She closes her curtains.

INT. GREAT SEPT

MARGAERY & TOMMEN: I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.

Tommen and Margaery share a kiss. Cersei watches them from the crowd, emotionless. The newlyweds turn to the crowd, holding hands. Everyone claps. They smile and laugh. Cersei claps as well, and forces herself to smile.

INT. TOMMENS CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT

Tommen breathes heavily as he and Margaery finish having sex. She turns onto her side and smiles.

TOMMEN: Did I hurt you?

MARGAERY: No. You were lovely.

TOMMEN: It all happened so fast.

MARGAERY: Yes. (Chuckles).

TOMMEN: I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded

MARGAERY: No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.

TOMMEN: This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.

MARGAERY: Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?

TOMMEN: Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?

MARGAERY: No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.

TOMMEN: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

MARGAERY: So strange Husband.

TOMMEN: Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died.

MARGAERY: I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.

TOMMEN: I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.

Margaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.

TOMMEN: Do you like to sail?

MARGAERY: (Sits up). I love to sail.

TOMMEN: I do, too.

MARGAERY: I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.

TOMMEN: I do, too.

She kisses him and turns around. She gets up, wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover.

MARGAERY: Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?

TOMMEN: I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

MARGAERY: It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).

TOMMEN: Well, but I'm a man now.

MARGAERY: You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.

TOMMEN: I suppose.

MARGAERY: I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.

EXT. CASTLE WALL

Cersei and Tommen walk together, her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them.

CERSEI: You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.

TOMMEN: Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

CERSEI: There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

TOMMEN: That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

CERSEI: (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

TOMMEN: The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.

CERSEI: This is my real home now. Where my family lives.

TOMMEN: I want you to be happy, mother.

CERSEI: I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.

TOMMEN: But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

INT. ROOM

Cersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside, Margaery is having tea with some of her friends.

MARGAERY: I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?" (Laugher). And he said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."

Margaerys friends laugh. As Cersei walks in, they all get up and bow.

MARGAERY: Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.

CERSEI: Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.

MARGAERY: Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.

CERSEI: No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.

MARGAERY: You are very sweet.

CERSEI: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.

MARGAERY: I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.

CERSEI: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

MARGAERY: Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaerys friends laugh).

CERSEI: I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).

MARGAERY: Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

CERSEI: There's no need for such formalities.

MARGAERY: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.

CERSEI: Wont that be a lovely day.

MARGAERY: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.

CERSEI: Remember. Anything you need.

Margaery smiles. Cersei leaves. Margaerys smile fades. It returns when her friends begin laughing, and she turns back around. Cersei walks away with her two guards, still able to hear the laughter.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

EXT. COURTYARD

A horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep, a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon, carrying a dead bird, walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking, head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart.

INT. DINING HALL

Roose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed.

ROOSE: We can't hold the North with terror alone.

RAMSAY: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.

ROOSE: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.

RAMSAY: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.

Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate.

ROOSE: He left you no choice.

RAMSAY: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.

ROOSE: And?

RAMSAY: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

ROOSE: (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.

Ramsay, who had been heavily engrossed in his eating, stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back, looking at his father.

ROOSE: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?

RAMSAY: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -

ROOSE: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.

CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN

EXT. NEARBY HILLS

Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights ride towards Moat Cailin. The party stops. Baelish leads Sansa on foot to a spot where they can easily overlook the keep. The keep is shown, surrounded by swampy riverlands.

SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.

BAELISH: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.

SANSA: On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and where are you taking me?

BAELISH: Home.

SANSA: The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?

BAELISH: (Shakes his head). No.

SANSA: Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!

BAELISH: He did.

SANSA: He serves the Lannisters.

BAELISH: For now.

SANSA: I won't go.

BAELISH: Winterfell is your home.

SANSA: Not anymore.

BAELISH: Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.

SANSA: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.

BAELISH: You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -

SANSA: No!

BAELISH: Sansa -

SANSA: No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.

BAELISH: (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.

He kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments, she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby, Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep.

PODRICK: How do we get through there?

BRIENNE: We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).

PODRICK: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.

BRIENNE: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.

EXT. CAMPSITE

Podrick sits scrubbing a boot.

BRIENNE: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

PODRICK: He hates that nickname.

BRIENNE: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?

Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on.

PODRICK: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

BRIENNE: He borrowed it?

PODRICK: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.

BRIENNE: As punishment. For both of you.

PODRICK: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

BRIENNE: (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.

PODRICK: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.

BRIENNE: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

PODRICK: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.

BRIENNE: You want to be a knight, Pod?

PODRICK: Yes.

BRIENNE: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.

PODRICK: Thank you.

BRIENNE: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.

PODRICK: I suppose that's more important.

Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark, and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up, walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off.

PODRICK: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

BRIENNE: I was.

PODRICK: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

BRIENNE: He was.

PODRICK: But how did you end up serving Renly?

BRIENNE: (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. Brienne the Beauty, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. Don't let them see your tears, he told me. Theyre nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over. He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.

PODRICK: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...

BRIENNE: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.

PODRICK: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?

BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

INT. LORD COMMANDERS ROOM

Olly opens the door for Stannis and Davos. Jon sits at his desk.

STANNIS: Lord Commander.

JON: (Stands up). Your Grace.

STANNIS: (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.

JON: Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.

STANNIS: Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?

JON: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

STANNIS: Say the word and you will be.

JON: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.

STANNIS: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.

JON: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

STANNIS: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.

JON: I can imagine no higher praise.

STANNIS: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your minds made up, I won't try to persuade you.

JON: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?

STANNIS: Are you bored of us already?

JON: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.

STANNIS: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.

JON: And the wildlings?

STANNIS: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.

JON: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).

STANNIS: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

Stannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.

STANNIS: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

JON: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

STANNIS: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

Stannis leaves. Davos begins to leave, but turns to Jon as Jon begins to pace.

DAVOS: He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.

JON: I'm sorry I disappointed him.

Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.

DAVOS: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.

JON: As long as he's ruling them.

DAVOS: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.

JON: Ive sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

DAVOS: Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

Olly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him, crosses his arms, and nods.

OLLY: Night gathers and now my watch begins -

DAVOS: Not that bit, the bit at the end.

OLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -

DAVOS: Wait, that's enough. The shield that guards the realm of men. That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.

JON: And what needs to be done?

DAVOS: As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.

Davos nods and turns to leave. Olly opens the door for him. Jon sits at his desk and sighs.

CUT TO: BRAAVOS

INT. ARYAS ROOM

Arya lays on her bed, playing with her coin in her hand. Suddenly, the door opens, and she sits up. The waif enters with a cane, and begins pacing.

ARYA: What do you want?

WAIF: Who are you?

ARYA: What?

WAIF: You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?

ARYA: (After a moment, perks up). No one.

The waif quickly swings her cane at Arya, hitting her arm. Arya, now on her feet, turns to face the waif, holding her arm in pain.

ARYA: Ow! Cunt!

WAIF: A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?

ARYA: I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -

The waif hits her a third time, sending her to the ground.

WAIF: Who are you?

ARYA: You're about to find out.

Arya reaches for her sword. Before she can pick it up, Jaqen appears.

JAQEN: What are you doing?

WAIF: We were only playing. The game of faces.

JAQEN: A girl is not ready.

WAIF: Clearly not.

ARYA: (Stands up). I am ready.

JAQEN: For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

The waif turns to her. Jaqen looks at the sword on Aryas bed.

JAQEN: Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

The waif, looking smug, leaves.

EXT. DOCK

On a dock near the house of Black and White, Arya wraps a rock in her clothes. She is wearing new clothes, similar to the ones the waif wears. She ties them up and drops them into the water, the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand, she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment, and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea, but finds herself unable to, and begins to sob. She turns and walks over to some nearby rocks, and hides the sword under some of them.

INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

Arya is again sweeping the floor in the main room. She notices the men from the beginning of the episode carrying another dead body into the back room. However, after a moment, she realizes that she didnt hear the door close, and she looks up to find it wide open. Jaqen surprises her by suddenly putting his hand on her shoulder. He nods towards the door, and begins walking over to it. Arya follows him, leaving the broom outside. They go down a fire-lit tunnel. Jaqen opens the door at the end of the tunnel to reveal a chamber. Inside, the waif stands motionless next to a large stone slab. On it is the dead man. Jaqen leaves through the back door. After Jaqen closes the door, the waif begins to remove the dead mans clothes. She looks up at Arya, who walks over and begins to do so as well. The waif inspects his body. She wets a rag and begins cleaning off the man.

ARYA: What do we do with them after we wash them?

The waif only looks up and smiles lightly, making no other response. She goes back to washing him, and Arya wets a rag of her own to help.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

EXT. COURTYARD

MAN: Open gates!

The gates are opened. Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights on horseback gallop through. They stop. Theon watches from nearby through some metal bars, trembling. Baelish gets off of his horse. Roose, Ramsay, and Walda watch as Sansa gets off hers. Roose walks forward. Baelish leads Sansa towards him, rubbing her hands.

ROOSE: Lady Sansa, welcome.

After a tense moment, Sansa smiles and curtsies.

SANSA: (Smiles). Lord Bolton.

ROOSE: May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?

Ramsay smiles and walks forwards, removing his gloves. Sansa smiles at him.

RAMSAY: It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.

He takes her hand and kisses it. Nearby, Myranda and other women watch.

INT. HALLWAY

An old servant woman leads Sansa down a hallway to her chambers. She opens the door.

WOMAN: I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.

SANSA: Thank you.

WOMAN: Welcome home, Lady Stark. (Quieter) The North remembers.

Sansa watches as the woman leaves.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

INT. DINING HALL

Jon sits at a table, tapping his fingers anxiously. The men in the room talk amongst themselves.

JON: Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemons chair). Maester Aemon?

SAM: He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.

JON: Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.

Everyone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well.

JON: Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.

Some of the men shout in approval. Alliser looks up surprised. Edd and Sam look at each other. Janos pats him on the shoulder.

JON: Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

JANOS: (Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.

JON: Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -

JANOS: I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.

Some of the men begin talking loudly. Olly shifts in his seat.

SAM: Alright, alright! Enough of that.

JON: You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.

JANOS: (Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!

JON: Are you refusing to obey my order?

The men in the room all turn to look at Janos.

JANOS: You can stick your order up your bastard arse.

Some of the men whisper in shock. Janos looks pleased with himself. Alliser turns to Jon smugly.

JON: Take Lord Janos outside.

The men begin to stand up. Janos scoffs.

JON: Olly, bring me my sword.

Olly turns quickly to Jon, then gets up. Janos looks more unsure of himself as more men get up. Alliser turns and looks at Janos disapprovingly. Edd walks over to get Janos. Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside.

JANOS: You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.

Someone puts a chopping block down. Janos is taken up to it.

JANOS: A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!

Jon takes a final sip of his wine, gets up, and goes outside. The watchmen all gather in the courtyard. Olly hands Jon his sword. Jon walks up to where Janos is being held. Stannis watches from afar. Jon unsheathes his sword, and Janos looks up at it.

JON: If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.

JANOS: (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.

Janos sobs for a few moments. Jon hesitates, and then brings his sword down, decapitating Janos. He hands his sword to a watchman standing nearby. He looks up and makes eye contact with Stannis.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

INT. BROTHEL

The High Septon kneels in the center of a room. Seven prostitutes, dressed as each of the new gods, circle around him. Olyvar stands behind the High Septon, wearing a fake beard and holding a scale. The prostitutes giggle as the High Septon eyes them all.

OLYVAR: You have served us well, my son.

HIGH SEPTON: Thank you, Father.

OLYVAR: Which of the Seven will you worship today?

HIGH SEPTON: The Maiden.

OLYVAR: Where is the Maiden?

HIGH SEPTON: And the Stranger.

OLYVAR: (Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?

HIGH SEPTON: Yes, yes.

Olyvar snaps his fingers. He and five of the prostitutes step aside. The two dressed as the Maiden and the Stranger remain and approach the High Septon, who smiles. Suddenly, some men led by Lancel Lannister barge into the room. The High Septon gasps and turns around.

OLYVAR: What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -

The men force the High Septon to his feet. One of the men rips off Olyvars fake beard, hits him to the ground, and begins kicking him. The prostitutes run out of the room.

LANCEL: You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.

HIGH SEPTON: I am the High Septon of the -

LANCEL: (Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.

The men drag the High Septon out of the room. He is forced out into the street naked, and begin walking. He tries to cover his penis with his hands, but one of the men hits him with a stick. People gather on the sides of the street to watch, and begin chanting.

CROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

MAN 1: Repent!

CROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

MAN 2: Shame on you!

CROWD: Sinner! Sinner!

INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER

Mace opens the door for the High Septon. He approaches the table. In better light, it is clear that his face is heavily bruised. Mace closes the door and walks over. The High Septon addresses each of the member present.

HIGH SEPTON: (To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh

QYBURN: It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).

HIGH SEPTON: As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.

CERSEI: You were assaulted?

HIGH SEPTON: I was, by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.

QYBURN: I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.

MACE: High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.

HIGH SEPTON: I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.

QYBURN: So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

PYCELLE: A man's private affairs ought to stay private!

CERSEI: What do you want from us, High Septon?

HIGH SEPTON: Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -

CERSEI: And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?

EXT. STREET

A soldier helps Cersei out of her carriage. She begins walking forward. Ser Meryn stands ahead of her.

MERYN: I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.

CERSEI: Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?

The man points up the stairs. They are crowded with people. Cersei and Ser Meryn ascend them.

MAN 1: Seven blessings.

Cersei covers her nose. At the top of the stairs is a large room. She watches as many people eat at tables.

MAN 2: Thank you.

MAN 3: Just a little more...

WOMAN: Thank you ever so for the soup!

In the center of the room, an old man is giving soup to people in line. Cersei approaches him.

CERSEI: A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?

HIGH SPARROW: High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.

WOMAN 2: Seven blessings to you.

HIGH SPARROW: Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line).

CERSEI: Why no shoes?

HIGH SPARROW: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.

CERSEI: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?

HIGH SPARROW: Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.

CERSEI: (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.

HIGH SPARROW: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.

CERSEI: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

HIGH SPARROW: Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.

CERSEI: The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.

HIGH SPARROW: I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.

CERSEI: (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.

INT. QYBURNS LAB

Qyburn pulls a rat out of a cage. He brings it over to a desk and holds a knife above it. The camera switches to his face, and blood splatters onto a protective lens. Cersei enters the room with a letter.

QYBURN: Your Grace.

CERSEI: Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter).

QYBURN: At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk).

CERSEI: How's your work coming along?

QYBURN: Very well.

CERSEI: You've made progress?

QYBURN: More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but

CERSEI: Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately".

Cersei leaves the room. Qyburn begins writing something down. Behind him on a table is a large object, covered by a sheet. After a few moments of writing, the object begins violently jerking around, and then stops.

QYBURN: Shh. Easy, friend.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

COURTYARD

Sansa walks through the busy courtyard. Theon is shoveling dirt nearby. He looks up to see her walking in his direction, and looks away, tense. On a platform above, Ramsay and Baelish stand, watching her.

RAMSAY: She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.

BAELISH: I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. Shes suffered enough.

RAMSAY: I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

BAELISH: I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.

RAMSAY: I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.

ROOSE: (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

RAMSAY: Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows).

BAELISH: He seems pleased.

ROOSE: Shouldn't he be?

BAELISH: (They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.

ROOSE: I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.

BAELISH: Then I have delivered everything I've promised.

ROOSE: And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

BAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

ROOSE: The Queen will be enraged.

BAELISH: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.

ROOSE: And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.

BAELISH: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.

ROOSE: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?

BAELISH: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.

ROOSE: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?

BAELISH: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.

ROOSE: I'd like to read the reply.

Roose walks away.

CUT TO: VOLANTIS

INT. VARYS AND TYRIONS CARRIAGE

Tyrion repeatedly opens and closes a window.

TYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

VARYS: Volantis is a large city.

TYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

VARYS: The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.

TYRION: Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

VARYS: I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.

TYRION: (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.

VARYS: It's a perfectly good face.

TYRION: I'm losing my mind.

VARYS: If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.

TYRION: Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf.

Tyrion knocks on the front of the carriage. The camera then pans over part of the city. Varys and Tyrion walk through a busy marketplace.

TYRION: Slaves.

VARYS: Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.

Varys and Tyrion arrive at a clearing in the market and stop. A woman speaks before a large crowd.

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.

CROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us.

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.

VARYS: (Aside) We should keep moving.

Noticing Tyrion is no longer next to him, he frantically looks around.

CROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) I was once as you are now.

The woman points to her cheek. Tyrion watches from some nearby steps, and drinks some wine.

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded...

TYRION: The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...

TYRION: Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).

PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!

TYRION: We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?

The priestess slowly turns her head to lock eyes with Tyrion.

TYRION: (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.

They return to the marketplace and continue walking. They stop at a large door, which a man is guarding. He rubs Tyrions head.

MAN: (Valyrian) Its good luck to rub a dwarfs head.

TYRION: It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

Varys rolls his eyes, exasperated. The man stares at him unamused.

INT. BROTHEL

TYRION: See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.

Elsewhere in the brothel, Jorah sets his cup down. Tyrion and Varys sit down at a table, and a woman comes to bring them wine.

VARYS: Thank you.

Tyrion clinks his glass against Varyss. A prostitute dressed as Daenerys walks through the brothel. Tyrion looks at her.

TYRION: Curious... hair. (She looks at him).

MAN: (Across the room). The mother of dragons!

He gestures for her to come over. She approaches their table.

TYRION: It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.

Jorah watches the prostitute, and then looks away.

VARYS: Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.

MAN: What makes you worth that much?

BLONDE PROSTITUTE: Im magic. (They laugh).

MAN: I bet you bloody are.

Jorah listens to this, appearing extremely uncomfortable.

TYRION: Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken.

Tyrion spots another prostitute, with shorter dark hair. He gets up.

VARYS: Where're you going?

TYRION: I need to speak to someone with hair.

Tyrion approaches the black haired prostitute.

TYRION: Hello?

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Hello.

TYRION: You've got no drink.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You've got no money.

TYRION: Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.

The blonde prostitute and the man giggle. Tyrion glances over at them.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.

TYRION: Thats because theyve never met a queen.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You're just saying that.

TYRION: You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Why?

TYRION: Because you have a skeptical mind.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: (Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. Were gonna have to wash you first.

She takes his hand, but Tyrion doesnt get up.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Come on.

TYRION: (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Of course you can. You're shy.

TYRION: I'm not.

BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Have another drink.

TYRION: Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? Ill go for a piss, thats a start.

She looks confused. Tyrion walks away. Varys, noticing that Tyrion is no longer in his view, gets up worriedly.

INT./EXT. WINDOW

Tyrion pisses out of a window, and sips his wine. He throws the cup out into the water below. He notices that someone is behind him.

TYRION: No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see its not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.

Jorah looks behind him. As Tyrion pulls up his pants, Jorah puts a rope around him and begins tying it.

TYRION: You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -

Jorah puts a rag over Tyrions mouth.

JORAH: I'm taking you to the Queen.

Tyrions eyes widen. Jorah picks him up and leaves.

END EPISODE
TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT. BEACH

A man hops out of his boat at night, and grabs a basket of fish. As he carries it on shore, Jorah knocks him out with a punch to the face. Looking around, he drags the man out of the water, and throws two coins on him. Jorah walks over to where he has Tyrion tied up. Tyrion is grunting, trying to cut the ropes binding him with a knife. Jorah picks up the knife and Tyrion. He throws Tyrion and his supplies into the boat, and then pushes it out to sea. Once it gains momentum, he hops in himself.

CUT TO: EXT. BOAT

A number of men walk around doing various tasks on deck. Jaime Lannister looks out from the side of the boat. He turns to the captain.

JAIME: Is that Estermont?

CAPTAIN: Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle.

INT. BELOW DECK

A knife hits a sandbag.

BRONN: Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?

JAIME: This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.

BRONN: You ever been to Dorne?

JAIME: No.

BRONN: I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.

JAIME: You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).

BRONN: (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

JAIME: We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,

BRONN: (Incredulously) Your niece?

Jaime and Bronn have a stare-off. After a moment, Jaime looks away. Bronn drinks some water.

BRONN: I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).

JAIME: That's why you're here.

BRONN: I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.

JAIME: Because I don't want to start a war.

BRONN: That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.

JAIME: It has to be me.

BRONN: (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -

JAIME: It has to be me.

BRONN: (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.

JAIME: (Quietly) Varys set him free.

BRONN: Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards.

JAIME: He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.

CUT TO: KINGS LANDING

INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER

Cersei sits in her chair, looking angry. At the table is Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, Mace Tyrell, and an empty chair.

MACE: The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -

CERSEI: How much can the Crown afford?

MACE: With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.

CERSEI: You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?

MACE: Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.

Mace smiles, as if expecting a laugh. Qyburn and Pycelle both look down. Maces smile fades. Cersei smiles.

CERSEI: You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.

MACE: Absolutely.

CERSEI: In person.

MACE: (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles).

CERSEI: We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.

MACE: I will be honored, Your Grace.

CERSEI: The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.

Ser Meryn walks into the room. Mace turns to look at him, and then back at Cersei.

MACE: My very own Kingsguard? Please express -

CERSEI: Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

MACE: (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.

Mace laughs. Qyburn looks down, lightly chuckling. Mace exits, followed by Ser Meryn.

PYCELLE: The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

CERSEI: (Walking out). Not small enough.

Pycelle watches her leave.

INT. HIGH SPARROWS CHAMBER

A note lies on the desk, stamped with the seal of the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow sits behind his desk, across from Cersei. She pours a glass of wine.

CERSEI: May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?

HIGH SPARROW: No. (Smiles).

Cersei looks unsure, presumably having expected him to say yes. After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away.

CERSEI: The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).

HIGH SPARROW: I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste.

CERSEI: Hmm.

HIGH SPARROW: (After a moment). How may I serve?

CERSEI: All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

HIGH SPARROW: Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.

CERSEI: Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.

HIGH SPARROW: Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.

CERSEI: If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.

HIGH SPARROW: An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.

CERSEI: An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.

HIGH SPARROW: An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.

CERSEI: Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.

HIGH SPARROW: All sinners are equal before the Gods.

CERSEI: (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.

HIGH SPARROW: May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).

EXT. STREET

A group of Faith Militant, wearing black robes and chains, walk down the street. Many nearby people chatter amongst themselves and look on. They begin breaking open casks of wine, and people begin screaming. One throws some men out of a building. Wine from the broken casks flows down some steps.

INT. A ROOM

We see a man in pain, sweating heavily and biting down on a piece of cloth. Someone begins carving something on his forehead, and his hand scratches and grabs at the table.

EXT. MARKETPLACE

Outside, the Faith Militant destroy a marketplace, smashing things for sale, flipping over tables, and attacking merchants. One merchant, laying on the ground, looks up at some gold cloaks on a castle wall.

MERCHANT: Help me! Help me!

The gold cloaks turn around, ignoring him.

INT. A ROOM

The man in the room continues to sweat and bite down on the cloth. His face trembles. The symbol continues being carved.

INT. BROTHEL

A prostitute moans while having sex with a client. Some Faith Militant walk in and interrupt. She shrieks as one grabs her by the hair and pulls her off of the man. Another comes in grinning and strikes the man with a stick. The prostitute is forced out of the room. Some more men interrupt an orgy. Two women start screaming. They begin beating some of the participants, and taking others out of the room. Olyvar attempts to confront a member of the Faith Militant as the man drags out a prostitute.

OLYVAR: (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

The man elbows Olyvar in the face and continues on his way. After most of the Faiths Militant are gone, Olyvar hears a scream. He walks towards the source of the scream, blood running from his noise, and hears another scream.

MILITANT: Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.

Olyvar stands just outside the doorway of a large room. Inside, a group of militants, most of them armed, stand around a male prostitute and his male client. Both are naked and bloody on the floor.

CLIENT: Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.

MILITANT: (Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him.

The client begins crying. Olyvar backs out of the doorway and begins running away. The client screams.

INT. A ROOM

Someone finishes carving the symbol on the mans head. The carver walks away and the man, revealed to be Lancel Lannister, sits up, breathing heavily. The symbol on his forehead is the symbol of the Faith Militant.

EXT. STAIRWELL

A number of Faiths Militant, all armed, walk down a stairwell. They enter a clearing, where Loras Tyrell is sparring with another man. Some people are spectating. The militants, including Lancel, approach the fight. Loras, having knocked the other man to the ground, removes his helmet. He hands his sword to another man, who hands Loras a drink. He suddenly becomes aware of the presence of the militants.

MILITANT: Seize him.

The militants grab Loras.

LORAS: Get your hands off of me.

LANCEL: Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.

LORAS: Who do you think you are?

LANCEL: Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).

INT. HALLWAY

Margaery walks down a hallway. She pushes a set of doors open, enters Tommens chambers, and angrily puts her hands on a table. Tommen is eating, and looks up at her, surprised.

MARGAERY: Why is my brother in a cell?

TOMMEN: I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.

MARGAERY: We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.

TOMMEN: (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?

MARGAERY: She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.

TOMMEN: Aren't you and mother getting along?

MARGAERY: (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?

TOMMEN: (Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.

MARGAERY: I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.

TOMMEN: I'll set him free for you.

MARGAERY: Do you promise?

INT. CERSEIS CHAMBERS

Tommen walks into Cerseis chambers. Cersei is staring out of a window and drinking wine.

TOMMEN: I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!

CERSEI: (Turns around). Did I arrest him?

TOMMEN: Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.

CERSEI: I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.

TOMMEN: Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?

CERSEI: I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.

EXT. THE GREAT SEPT

A group of kingsguard lead Tommen to the Great Sept.

KINGSGUARD: Halt!

The party stops. Tommen gets out and goes to the steps of the Sept on foot, followed by guards. A number of people are seen milling about around the base of the steps. Some Faith Militant stand guarding the steps. They block Tommen and his guards from walking up.

MILITANT: His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.

KINGSGUARD: Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.

TOMMEN: You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?

KINGSGUARD: You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.

The kingsguard and militants both adjust their stances, ready for a fight. A number of other people begin to watch. Some people begin yelling at Tommen.

MAN 1: Bastard!

MAN 2: You're an abomination!

MAN 3: You're born of sin!

WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

TOMMEN: We'll find another way.

Tommen begins walking away, followed by his guards.

MAN 4: Abomination!

INT. TOMMENS CHAMBERS

Tommen opens the doors to his chambers, finding it empty.

TOMMEN: My Queen?

Margaery enters from outside.

TOMMEN: There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.

MARGAERY: You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.

TOMMEN: I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.

MARGAERY: Are you? When?

TOMMEN: I--I don't know.

MARGAERY: You don't know?

TOMMEN: He was praying just now.

MARGAERY: (Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.

TOMMEN: Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).

MARGAERY: I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking).

TOMMEN: Of course.

CUT TO: THE WALL

EXT. CASTLE BLACK

Some Nights Watchmen spar in the courtyard. A number of others look on. Stannis and Selyse watch from some stairs.

SELYSE: You think highly of this boy.

JON: (To some of the men sparring). Good.

STANNIS: Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

SELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.

STANNIS: Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

SELYSE: I should have given you a son.

STANNIS: Not your fault.

SELYSE: Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).

MELISANDRE: (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.

SELYSE: My Lady.

MELISANDRE: Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.

Melisandre and Selyse stare at each other. After a moment, Selyse walks away.

MELISANDRE: You march on Winterfell soon?

STANNIS: We must. To beat the snows.

MELISANDRE: Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.

STANNIS: I won't. I need you.

MELISANDRE: You only need faith, my King.

STANNIS: (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?

MELISANDRE: To serve my Lord.

Stannis turns back. They both watch Jon sparring.

INT. JONS CHAMBER

Jon sits at his desk. Sam hands him various letters to sign, one by one.

SAM: Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Coalfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.

JON: Never even heard of these people.

SAM: They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.

JON: And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us?

SAM: (Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Weebly.

Sams face grows dark after reading the next letter. When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Weebly, Sam hands it to him, saying nothing. Jon begins signing, but hesitates.

JON: Not him.

SAM: I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.

JON: He murdered my brother.

SAM: We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.

Jon hesitates another moment, and then relents and signs the letter. He leans his chair back, and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters. He walks away, almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jons chambers.

SAM: Apologies, my Lady.

Sam and Melisandre both look at Jon. Jon nods at Sam, and he leaves. Melisandre closes the door behind him, and Jon straightens up his posture.

MELISANDRE: Lord Commander.

JON: How can I help you?

MELISANDRE: Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon).

JON: Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

MELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).

JON: You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.

MELISANDRE: No visions. No magic. Just life.

She opens up her robes, naked underneath. She leans back, and takes Jons hand, slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast.

MELISANDRE: Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.

Melisandre smiles and looks down at Jons hand. Jon looks too. Realizing that she is no longer holding it there, he quickly pulls it away. Melisandre caresses Jons face and sits on his lap.

MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.

JON: I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

MELISANDRE: Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jons coat).

JON: I can't.

MELISANDRE: Why?

JON: I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.

MELISANDRE: The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.

Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further, breathing heavily.

JON: I know. But I still love her.

Melisandre stands up, closes her robes, and walks away. After opening the door to leave, she turns to Jon.

MELISANDRE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Jons mouth opens a bit. She smirks and leaves.

INT. STANNISS ROOM

Stannis sits at his desk, reading something. Theres a knock at the door. After a moment, Shireen enters. Stannis looks up at her and then back down at his reading material. She closes the door. She smiles, but after Stannis doesnt return her smile, she walks over to a nearby dresser and begins playing with the objects on top of it.

STANNIS: Are you lonely?

SHIREEN: (Turns around, holding something). Just bored.

STANNIS: My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.

SHIREEN: (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?

STANNIS: I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -

SHIREEN: I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).

STANNIS: Why do you say that?

SHIREEN: She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

Shireen fiddles with the objects in her hands. Stannis looks down.

STANNIS: She shouldn't have said that.

Shireen puts down the objects she was playing with, and turns to leave. Before opening the door, she turns back to Stannis.

SHIREEN: Are you ashamed of me, father?

Stannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down.

STANNIS: When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireens smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.

After a moment, Shireen hugs Stannis. At first hesitant, he hugs her back.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

INT. TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL

Sansa lights a candle on a tomb. She then walks over to Lyannas tomb and places a candle in the hand of Lyannas statue. She then leans down to pick a dusty feather off of the ground. As she blows off the dust, a figure is seen approaching in the background.

BAELISH: I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.

SANSA: Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.

BAELISH: I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

SANSA: Yes, he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her.

BAELISH: Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).

SANSA: Dressed for riding?

BAELISH: I am.

SANSA: Where are you going?

BAELISH: King's Landing.

SANSA: King's Landing?

BAELISH: Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.

SANSA: You can't leave me here!

BAELISH: I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.

SANSA: How do you know?

BAELISH: (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.

SANSA: You don't know that.

BAELISH: I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

SANSA: You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

BAELISH: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man.

SANSA: And if you're right?

BAELISH: Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.

SANSA: But I, I wouldn't Wardeness of the North

BAELISH: You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.

SANSA: What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?

BAELISH: Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.

SANSA: I don't know how to do that.

BAELISH: Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.

SANSA: His father frightens me.

BAELISH: He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And youve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?

SANSA: I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.

Baelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.

CUT TO: DORNE

EXT. BOAT

At night, Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime, Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore, they carry their boat in, and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away.

EXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING

Jaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it.

BRONN: Breakfast.

Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.

BRONN: That would have been a shit way to die.

JAIME: As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.

BRONN: Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.

JAIME: I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.

BRONN: No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.

JAIME: Sounds like all the rest.

While Bronn is distracted eating, Jaime gets rid of his food.

JAIME: What about you? What shit way would you choose?

BRONN: In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

JAIME: How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.

BRONN: I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?

JAIME: In the arms of the woman I love.

BRONN: She want the same thing?

JAIME: Let's go.

They both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.

BRONN: The captain to that ship What was he, Braavosi?

JAIME: Pentoshi.

BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?

JAIME: As I said. Why?

BRONN: What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?

JAIME: A bag of gold.

BRONN: I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.

JAIME: It was a heavy bag.

BRONN: And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.

A horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.

BRONN: How many you count?

JAIME: Four.

BRONN: How many you think you can take?

JAIME: One, if he's slow.

Bronn turns to look at the riders.

RIDER: Halt!

The rider holds up his hand, and the party stops, having spotted Jaime and Bronns footsteps.

BRONN: Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you.

RIDER: Who are you?

BRONN: Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.

RIDER: You're from King's Landing.

BRONN: Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.

RIDER: Why are you here?

BRONN: Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.

JAIME: I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).

RIDER: There are no sharks in Dorne.

JAIME: I could have sworn those were shark fins.

BRONN: Dolphins maybe.

RIDER: Throw your swords in the sand.

BRONN: Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.

RIDER: Swords in the sand! Now!

Bronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand, and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another, stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him, and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However, he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime.

BRONN: That one should be slow enough.

Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider, who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background, Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight, Jaime is slowly pushed back, down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime, Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaimes hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword, Jaime picks his back up, kills him, and kicks him down the hill.

BRONN: Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).

JAIME: Luck.

BRONN: You had a wonderful teacher.

Bronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill, and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off, he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches.

BRONN: Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.

JAIME: First we need to bury these bodies.

BRONN: Birds have to eat too.

JAIME: Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.

BRONN: Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?

JAIME: (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.

Jaime walks away as Bronns face drops. He begins dragging a body.

EXT. BEACH

Elaria, in all black, swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses, and in the tent are Nymeria, Obara, and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts.

TYENE: Nama!

Tyene and Elaria embrace.

ELARIA: Nym, Obara.

OBARA: Will it be war?

ELARIA: Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

OBARA: Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.

ELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.

NYMERIA: We may have a problem.

Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions.

OBARA: A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

ELARIA: He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.

TYENE: (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).

ELARIA: Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?

OBARA: When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, "Girl or boy, we fight our battles. But the Gods let us choose our weapons." My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears.

Obara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand. She twirls it around for a moment, and then tosses it through the captains head, killing him.

OBARA: (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.

Elaria and Tyene smile.

CUT TO: EXT. BOAT AT SEA

Jorah steers the boat as Tyrion, tied up and gagged, tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words, and instead only tries to be as loud as possible, to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him, and then walks back over to continue steering.

TYRION: Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?

JORAH: Your captor.

TYRION: Do you have wine?

JORAH: No.

TYRION: I can't sleep without wine.

JORAH: Then stay awake.

TYRION: You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.

JORAH: I'm not taking you to your sister.

TYRION: You said you were taking me to the Queen.

JORAH: I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.

TYRION: (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!

JORAH: What business would you have with the Queen?

TYRION: Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

Jorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion. Tyrion holds out his hands again, but Jorah strikes him, knocking him unconscious. He then goes back to steering, looking worried.

CUT TO: YUNKAI

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY

Daenerys and Ser Barristan stand on the balcony.

DAENERYS: Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?

BARRISTAN: I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.

DAENERYS: Why?

BARRISTAN: He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.

DAENERYS: He sang to them?

BARRISTAN: Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.

DAENERYS: And what did you do?

BARRISTAN: I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.

DAENERYS: He was good?

BARRISTAN: He was very good. Viserys never told you?

DAENERYS: He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).

BARRISTAN: Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.

DAENERYS: And what did you do with the money?

BARRISTAN: Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh).

DARIO: (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.

DAENERYS: How many others are there?

DARIO: Fifty a hundred.

DAENERYS: Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

DARIO: I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.

DAENERYS: I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

BARRISTAN: Your Grace. (Leaves).

INT. AUDIENCE CHAMBER

HIZDAHR: All men must die. But not all can die in glory.

MISSANDEI: Glory?

HIZDAHR: Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.

DAENERYS: Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?

HIZDAHR: Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.

DAENERYS: I do not recognize this tradition.

HIZDAHR: Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.

EXT. MARKETPLACE

A prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area, causing panic. In a nearby alley, some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos, they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier.

WOMAN: (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.

She gestures in the direction the sons went. The Unsullied run in that direction. When they are out of view, she stops her act and wipes the tears away. The Unsullied enter a corridor, expecting to catch the sons. Instead, they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments, a fight breaks out. During the fight, one of the Unsullieds helmet is knocked off, and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and, upon noticing the chaos, heads to the fighting. Grey Worm is badly injured, and with his party killed, also badly outnumbered. Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere. Grey Worm continues holding off the sons, and Barristan arrives to assist him. They are able to kill all of the sons, but are both seriously injured in the process. They fall unconscious, and the camera pans up to show them surrounded by all of the dead sons and Unsullied.

END EPISODE
TITLE SEQUENCE

INT. ROOM

Grey Worm lays in a bed, asleep. Missandei stands over him, crying.

INT. THRONE ROOM

The room is dark, except for some candles. Daenerys and Daario stand over the body of Barristan. Hizdahr enters with two men.

HIZDAHR: I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.

DAENERYS: "Barristan the Bold" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.

DAARIO: We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

Daario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr. He looks back. Daenerys turns around.

DAENERYS: I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.

HIZDAHR: But... I'm the leader of my family.

Daario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.

HIZDAHR: No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!

INT. DRAGON CHAMBER

Daenerys, Daario, some Unsullied, and a number of men stand in the chamber. Daario holds a torch. After a few moments, Daenerys turns around and begins walking. Daario follows her. Then a chain can be heard rattling. Daenerys and Daario turn around.

DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Walk forward.

The Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.

MAN: (Valyrian) You cannot do this.

The Unsullied begin walking forward, forcing the men to move. After a few moments, they stop. Chains rattle again.

DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Another step.

The Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.

DAENERYS: (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I dont. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.

Daenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward, onto his knees.

DAENERYS: (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.

The mans eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse, tear it in two, and eat it.

DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahrs arm), I should let the dragons decide.

HIZDAHR: (Valyrian) All men must die.

The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment, she takes her hand off of Hizdahr.

DAENERYS: Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.

Daario and the Unsullied take the men out. Daenerys watches her dragons eat for a moment, and then walks out herself.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

INT. LIBRARY

Sam sits at a table, reading a letter. Aemon is with him.

SAM: "And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure." She sounds like quite a woman.

AEMON: And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.

SAM: Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

AEMON: A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.

Jon walks in.

JON: Maester Aemon.

AEMON: Lord Commander.

JON: Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

Sam gets up, grabs his papers, and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table.

JON: How are you feeling?

AEMON: Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.

JON: I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.

AEMON: Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.

JON: But you don't know what it is.

AEMON: That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.

INT. ROOM

Jon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table.

JON: Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?

TORMUND: They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.

JON: What about you?

TORMUND: Hard to lead when you're in chains.

JON: What if I unchained you?

TORMUND: Why would you do that?

JON: Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.

TORMUND: You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.

JON: For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.

TORMUND: And now everything is going to change?

JON: It is.

TORMUND: Why now?

JON: Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

TORMUND: What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?

JON: (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.

TORMUND: They won't kneel for you and neither will I.

JON: I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.

TORMUND: The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.

JON: And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.

TORMUND: (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

Jon unchains Tormund. Tormunds eyes widen as he feels his hands.

JON: Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.

TORMUND: Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?

JON: Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.

TORMUND: We'll need ships.

JON: I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.

TORMUND: All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding wont be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.

INT. DINING HALL

The Nights Watchmen present talk amongst themselves. Stannis and Davos are present. Jon stands at a table in the front of the room with Allister and two others. One of them addresses Jon.

MAN 1: You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?

JON: Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

MAN 1: Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.

Some of the men in the crowd cheer.

STANNIS: Fewer.

DAVOS: What?

STANNIS: Nothing.

SAM: (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.

MAN 2: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.

The man points to Olly, who lowers his head. Sam sits down.

ALLISTER: We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.

JON: And we've slaughtered theirs.

EDD: I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.

JON: You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.

The men in the room return to bickering loudly.

INT. LORD COMMANDERS ROOM

Jon walks in, takes off his coat, and puts his hands on his desk. Olly knocks and walks in with a plate of food, and sets it down.

JON: Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.

OLLY: You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.

JON: It's not a trick.

OLLY: They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.

JON: I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.

OLLY: Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?

JON: No.

Olly leaves. Jon sighs.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL

EXT. COURTYARD

Podrick walks carrying some supplies. He enters a building. Inside, Brienne stares out of a window. Podrick sets down the supplies.

PODRICK: She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

BRIENNE: (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.

A man enters with some water and a towel.

BRIENNE: Thank you. You've lived here a long time?

MAN: Aye.

BRIENNE: Did you know Lord Eddard?

MAN: I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.

BRIENNE: Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.

MAN: Everyone knows. The Boltons.

BRIENNE: I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.

MAN: Who are you?

BRIENNE: Someone who swore to keep her safe.

MAN: Swore to who?

BRIENNE: Her mother.

MAN: Her mother's dead.

BRIENNE: That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?

INT. RAMSAYS CHAMBERS

Myranda stands naked in front of a window.

RAMSAY: Come back here. Myranda.

MYRANDA: I saw you staring at her.

RAMSAY: I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.

MYRANDA: You said you'd marry me.

RAMSAY: And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.

MYRANDA: Do you think she's pretty?

RAMSAY: Of course I do. I'm not blind.

Ramsay sighs and gets up. He walks over to Myranda and grabs her waist.

RAMSAY: You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.

MYRANDA: Perhaps I'll marry, too.

RAMSAY: (Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?

After a moment, Myranda kisses him. She then bites down hard on his lower lip, causing it to bleed.

MYRANDA: (Smiles). Never.

Ramsay smiles back. They begin having sex.

INT. SANSAS CHAMBERS

Sansa sits alone at a table. Theres a knock on the door. She turns, gets up, and opens it. An old servant woman comes in.

WOMAN: Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.

SANSA: Oh, I don't need-

WOMAN: (Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.

SANSA: But who -

WOMAN: You're not alone.

The woman leaves, and closes the door.

EXT. OUTSIDE

Sansa walks through the snow, looking up at the broken tower. Myranda approaches her.

MYRANDA: I like your dress. Who made it for you?

SANSA: I made it myself.

MYRANDA: Really?

SANSA: Who, who are you?

MYRANDA: I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansas arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?

SANSA: My mother. (Pulls away).

MYRANDA: I'm sorry for what happened to her.

SANSA: Thank you.

MYRANDA: It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.

SANSA: I'd rather have a mother.

MYRANDA: I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.

INT. DUNGEON ENTRANCE

Myranda opens the gate and lets Sansa in. Some dogs bark.

MYRANDA: Down there at the end.

SANSA: What is it?

MYRANDA: That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.

The dogs continue barking and growling. Sansa walks down the aisle of cages. Most contain dogs. Sansa looks behind to see Myranda has disappeared. She comes to the last cage, which is open. Inside is Theon, on the floor. He gets up and notices her.

SANSA: Theon?

THEON: You shouldn't be here.

She looks at him angrily. He backs away from her. She leaves.

INT. RAMSAYS CHAMBERS

Theon unties Ramsays jacket.

RAMSAY: You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.

Theon walks over to a table and pours some wine. He then brings it over to Ramsay, who drinks it.

RAMSAY: Do you have something to tell me?

THEON: No, my lord.

RAMSAY: Reek.

THEON: (Stuttering). She saw me.

RAMSAY: Who?

THEON: Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.

RAMSAY: She saw you?

THEON: Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -

RAMSAY: Come here.

Theon walks forward. Ramsay holds his chin.

RAMSAY: You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.

Theon gets on his knees. Ramsay sips his wine, and then puts it aside. Theon looks down.

RAMSAY: Give me your hand.

Theon hesitantly holds his hand up. As Ramsay takes it, Theon begins stammering. After a moment, Ramsay cups Theons hand with his own hands.

RAMSAY: I forgive you.

Theon looks up. Ramsay smiles.

INT. DINING HALL

Sansa, Ramsay, Roose, and Walda sit at a table, eating.

ROOSE: I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.

SANSA: Yes, thank you, my lord.

RAMSAY: Allow me.

Ramsay pours Sansa some wine.

RAMSAY: Mother.

WALDA: Thank you, Ramsay.

He pours her some wine as well. She smiles. Ramsay gets up and holds his wine up.

RAMSAY: My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.

ROOSE: (Raises his cup). To your wedding.

WALDA: (Raises her cup). To your wedding.

Ramsay takes a large sip of wine. Sansa puts her own glass down. Ramsay sits down.

WALDA: It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.

SANSA: This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.

RAMSAY: You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.

Theon enters the room with some wine. Sansa looks away.

RAMSAY: I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?

THEON: (Turns around). Yes, master.

RAMSAY: That's his new name, Reek.

SANSA: Why are you doing this?

RAMSAY: Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

Theon shakes his head "no" when Ramsay looks away

THEON: (After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry.

RAMSAY: Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.

THEON: I'm sorry.

RAMSAY: Sorry about what?

THEON: For killing your brothers.

RAMSAY: There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?

ROOSE: Yes, yes, very good.

RAMSAY: Wonderful. (Sips wine).

ROOSE: Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.

WALDA: We're going to have a baby.

SANSA: I'm very happy for you.

ROOSE: From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

Ramsay sips some wine and angrily sets his cup down. Sansa looks at him smugly.

INT. ROOSES WAR ROOM

Ramsay and Roose sit at a war table.

RAMSAY: How can you be sure?

ROOSE: Sure of what?

RAMSAY: That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?

ROOSE: Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.

Ramsay gets up and walks around to the other side of the table, wine in hand.

RAMSAY: So how did you manage it?

ROOSE: Manage what?

RAMSAY: Getting her pregnant.

ROOSE: I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

RAMSAY: Of course, but how did you find it?

ROOSE: You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.

RAMSAY: And if it's a boy?

ROOSE: You're worried about your position.

RAMSAY: My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.

Ramsay finished his wine and goes to get more.

ROOSE: You've never asked me about your mother.

RAMSAY: Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.

ROOSE: She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?

RAMSAY: Yes.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK

INT. LIBRARY

Gilly walks through the bookshelves, examining them. Sam sits at the table reading.

GILLY: Is this every book there is?

SAM: Every book there is?

GILLY: In the world.

SAM: Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.

GILLY: Where you grew up, were there more books?

SAM: My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.

GILLY: Where's that?

SAM: The Citadel? In Oldtown.

GILLY: I'm sorry I don't know things.

SAM: Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

GILLY: I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

SAM: Well -

GILLY: Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

SAM: It's where they train the maesters.

GILLY: Like Maester Aemon?

SAM: I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.

Stannis enters the library. Sam stands up.

SAM: Ah, Your Grace.

Gilly quickly exits.

STANNIS: You're Samwell Tarly?

SAM: I am, Your Grace.

STANNIS: Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.

SAM: I did, Your Grace.

STANNIS: How?

SAM: With a dagger made of dragonglass.

STANNIS: Dragonglass?

SAM: What the maesters call obsidian -

STANNIS: I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?

SAM: I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.

STANNIS: The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.

SAM: I've seen it, Your Grace.

STANNIS: Seen what?

SAM: The army of the dead. And when they come -

STANNIS: We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

Stannis leaves.

INT. DINING HALL

Davos carves away at a piece of wood. Stannis approaches him.

STANNIS: It's time.

DAVOS: Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.

STANNIS: If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.

DAVOS: I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.

STANNIS: No need, they're coming with us.

DAVOS: It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -

STANNIS: Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.

They walk outside.

DAVOS: As you wish, Your Grace.

Stannis walks away. Davos spots Melisandre.

EXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING

Stanniss men prepare to ride out. Sam and Gilly watch. Gilly holds baby Sam. Olly, Edd, and some other watchmen are also shown watching.

SHIREEN: (On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?

DAVOS: Beg your pardon?

SHIREEN: At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-

DAVOS: First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.

SHIREEN: Is there going to be a battle?

DAVOS: Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -

SELYSE: That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.

DAVOS: Yes, my queen.

SHIREEN: I'm not scared.

DAVOS: Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.

SHIREEN: (Smiling). I promise.

Shireen looks back at Gilly. Selyse catches her, and she looks down and away. Jon walks through the courtyard. He and Stannis meet on some stairs.

STANNIS: I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.

JON: You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.

Jon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre, but she looks away. Stannis and his army begin leaving.

CUT TO: MEEREN

INT. GREY WORMS ROOM

Missandei watches over Grey Worm. He suddenly gets up, startling her.

MISSANDEI:  You're still too weak. (He lays back down).

GREY WORM: (Valyrian) How long have I been here?

MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) Three days.

He looks at her. His face is bruised.

GREY WORM: Ser Barristan?

Missandei shakes her head.

GREY WORM: (Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.

MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. Youll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.

GREY WORM: This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.

MISSANDEI: All men fear death.

GREY WORM: No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.

Missandei looks down, on the verge of tears. She gets up and lies down in the bed with him, caressing his face, and then kissing him.

INT. DAENERYSS CHAMBERS

Missandei and Daenerys stand, talking.

MISSANDEI: Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.

DAENERYS: If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?

MISSANDEI: Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.

DAENERYS: (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?

MISSANDEI: I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.

INT. DUNGEONS

Daenerys is led by Unsullied to a room in a dungeon. The door is opened to reveal Hizdahr. She enters, and he kneels before her.

HIZDAHR: My, my queen, please do not do this.

DAENERYS: What about "Valar Morghulis"?

HIZDAHR: I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).

DAENERYS: It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.

HIZDAHR: Yes, my queen.

DAENERYS: And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

Hizdahr looks surprised. Daenerys faintly smiles, and then leaves. Hizdahr is left in the cell, with the door wide open.

CUT TO: SEA

EXT. JORAHS BOAT

Tyrion wakes up and feels his head.

TYRION: Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

JORAH: We are.

TYRION: What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.

JORAH: No wine.

TYRION: I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not

Jorah stands up and looks ahead. Tyrion turns as well. A large bank of fog lies ahead of the boat.

TYRION: I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.

JORAH: I am.

TYRION: Have you sailed this route before?

JORAH: No.

TYRION: You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?

JORAH: I think you'll be plenty.

TYRION: You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

JORAH: No. But the pirates are.

TYRION: Oh.

EXT. RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS

TYRION: The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -

JORAH: And then they weren't.

TYRION: And then they weren't. "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"

JORAH: "The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."

TYRION: I would clap.

He holds up his bound hands. Jorah smirks.

TYRION: I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.

They look at the approaching ruins of the city. Suddenly Tyrion spots Drogon passing overhead. He stands up. Both of them look up and watch as he passes. Behind Tyrion, someone hops in the water. Jorah hears the splash and turns to see the ripples.

TYRION: What was that?

The boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.

JORAH: Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!

Jorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.

JORAH: Get behind!

TYRION: Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!

Jorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion.

TYRION: Mormont! Mormont!

Jorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments, we see Tyrions perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open.

EXT. SHORE

JORAH: (Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.

Tyrion looks around. Jorah helps him up. He unsheathes his knife and cuts Tyrions binds.

JORAH: You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?

TYRION: (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.

JORAH: I suppose that's why they send them there.

TYRION: It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?

JORAH: We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.

TYRION: Without luck?

JORAH: We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?

TYRION: That's the best idea you've had all day.

Jorah walks away. After looking out for a moment, he stops, and pulls up his sleeve. He examines his wrist, which has the beginnings of greyscale. After a moment, he begins walking again.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - CHAMBER

Arya cleans, washes, and covers three different bodies. Two Faceless Men come in to carry the body away. Arya tries to follow them but the waif closes and locks the door.

ARYA: What are they doing with the bodies?

WAIF: Get back to work.

ARYA: No! Ive been here for weeks. Im not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why Im doing it.

WAIF: You will know why.

ARYA: When?

WAIF: When its time. Not before. Get back to work.

ARYA: When do I get to play the game?

WAIF: Game?

ARYA: The game. The game of faces.

WAIF: You tried already. You failed.

ARYA: I didnt even know I was playing.

WAIF: Who are you?

ARYA: No one.

WAIF: Get back to work.

ARYA: Well who are you? What are you doing here? Howd you get here?

WAIF: Im from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didnt want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. Ive been serving them ever since.

beat

WAIF: Was that true or a lie?

ARYA: What?

WAIF: Did you believe every word I said?

Arya is unsure.

WAIF: Get back to work.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Arya is asleep.

JAQEN: Who are you?

Arya wakes up and turns to him.

JAQEN: Who are you?

ARYA: Arya.

JAQEN: And where did you come from?

ARYA: Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. Im the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.

Jaqen hits Arya with a stick.

JAQEN: A lie.

ARYA: After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.

Jaqen hits her again.

JAQEN: A lie.

ARYA: I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.

Jaqen hits her.

JAQEN: A lie.

ARYA: A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldnt. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.

Jaqen hits her.

ARYA: I hated him.

Jaqen hits her.

ARYA: I hated him!

Jaqen hits her again.

ARYA: Thats not a lie!

JAQEN: The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?

ARYA: Yes.

Jaqen hits her. Arya starts bleeding from the mouth.

ARYA: Im not playing this stupid game anymore!

JAQEN: We never stop playing.

Jaqen exits the room.

EXT. SHORE

Jorah inspects the Grey Scale then covers it up.

TYRION: So, those villages we were supposed to find. We cant live on berries and roots.

JORAH: I can.

TYRION: Youre not hungry?

JORAH: Of course Im hungry.

TYRION: Youre an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.

JORAH: I am not your travelling companion.

TYRION: We are travelling together. In each others company. Therefore

JORAH: Do you ever shut up?

TYRION: I sailed from Kings Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.

Jorah sits down next to Tyrion.

JORAH: Why?

TYRION: Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.

JORAH: Im sure youve visited many brothels in many cities.

TYRION: I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didnt commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.

Jorah gets up.

TYRION: As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.

JORAH: What do you know about my father?

TYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? We shall never see his like again.

Jorah looks stunned.

TYRION: You didnt know. Im sorry. I am.

JORAH: How?

TYRION: I only know what I heard

JORAH (stronger): How?

TYRION: He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.

JORAH: We better keep moving.

He gets up and walks away, then Tyrion.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

Arya is scrubbing the floor. A man carries a young girl in and sets her by the pool. He walks over to Arya and she stops scrubbing.

MAN: Valar morghulis.

ARYA: Valar dohaeris.

MAN: I have nowhere else to go. Ive taken her to every healer in Braavos. Ive spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.

Arya looks the man in the eyes then walks over to the girl.

GIRL: It hurts.

ARYA: I know. Dont be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.

Arya fills a cup with the water.

ARYA: Ive devoted my life to him now. You dont want to hurt anymore. Drink.

The girl takes a sip. Jaqen watches from afar.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - BODY ROOM

Arya fixes the dead girls hair. Jaqen walks in from the door Arya was trying to open earlier and leads her in. Arya follows him down a staircase lit by fire.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - HALL OF FACES

Arya looks up and sees the room is filled with columns containing the faces of the dead. She walks through the room, examining the faces.

JAQEN: Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?

Arya scans through the faces then fixates on one face in particular - that of an old lady.

JAQEN: No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE

TYRION: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Roberts Rebellion.

JORAH: Do you believe in anything?

TYRION: I believe in many things.

JORAH: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

TYRION: No.

JORAH: Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought Id find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

TYRION: No.

JORAH: It's hard to be a cynic after that.

TYRION: Doesnt mean shes going to be a great queen.

JORAH: No it doesnt.

TYRION: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?

JORAH: First we have to conquer the world.

TYRION: We? Alright, lets assume your dreams come true. Shes ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?

JORAH: Then she rules.

TYRION: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? Thats justice?

JORAH: She is the rightful heir.

TYRION: Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?

Jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock.

JORAH: Shh! Its a slave ship

TYRION: Why is it anchored?

JORAH: They probably came ashore for--

MALKO: --water.

Malko and his men, all carrying swords, surround Tyrion and Jorah, smiling.

SAME PLACE - LATER

Tyrion and Jorahs hands are tied. Malko punches Jorah in the face. He gets up.

MALKO: Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

Malko punches Jorah again.

SLAVER: Salt mines.

MALKO: That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.

SLAVER: What about the dwarf?

MALKO: Worthless. Cut his throat.

The slavers man approaches Tyrion.

TYRION: Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, lets discuss this!

MALKO: And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarfs cock has magic powers.

The slaver puts his sword to Tyrions throat.

TYRION: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You cant just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?

SLAVER: It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

TYRION: Guess again.

Tyrion looks to Malko.

MALKO: The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

The slavers get Jorah and Tyrion to their feet.

JORAH: Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

MALKO: Were bound to Volantis, not Slavers Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.

TYRION: The fighting puts in Mereen! Youre in luck then, youre about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.

Malko looks at Tyrion and laughs.

TYRION: (looks at Jorah) Him.

MALKO: Him? Hes got to be 60 years old.

TYRION: Sure, hes a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!

Malko gestures to his men to bring Jorah closer.

Malko: Is that true?

Jorah nods.

TYRION: He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

Malko shakes his head and laughs.

TYRION: The Kingslayer!

MALKO: Jousting. Youre talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.

JORAH: I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.

Malko jumps up, shocked, and gets in Jorahs face.

MALKO: Liar.

JORAH: Its no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slavers Bay, put a sword in my hand, Ill prove my worth.

Malko looks in his eyes, smiles, then nods.

EXT. KINGS LANDING - STREETS

Littlefinger walks by the Faith Militant.

LANCEL: Lord Baelish.

BAELISH: Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.

LANCEL: Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.

BAELISH: Thats quite a family to abandon.

LANCEL: The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.

BAELISH: Well done.

He tries to walk past Lancel. Lancel puts his hand on Baelishs shoulder and stops him.

BAELISH: Im here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that Ill be delayed?

Lancel lets go.

LANCEL: Step carefully, Lord Baelish. Youll find that theres little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new Kings Landing.

BAELISH: We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.

INT. CERSEIS ROOM

BAELISH: Do you think its wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?

CERSEI: The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

BAELISH: Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.

CERSEI: The Kings orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras perversion?

BAELISH: House Tyrell wont tolerate these insults.

CERSEI: House Tyrell wont tolerate it? Im the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.

BAELISH: Ones choice of companion is a curious thing.

Cersei is silent for a moment.

CERSEI: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know youre still in mourning.

BAELISH: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

CERSEI: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.

BAELISH: I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.

CERSEI: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?

BAELISH: Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.

CERSEI: Good. (Cersei gets up) If theres nothing else.

BAELISH: There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldnt trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.

CERSEI: Thats not possible.

BAELISH: My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.

CERSEI: Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.

BAELISH: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.

CERSEI: We were fools to trust a turncloak.

BAELISH: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.

CERSEI: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.

BAELISH: I would counsel patience, your grace.

CERSEI: Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.

BAELISH: Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when theyre done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

CERSEI: Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.

BAELISH: That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

CERSEI: My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.

BAELISH: Ser Jaime, then.

CERSEI: Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. Ive no idea when hell be back.

BAELISH: Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

CERSEI: Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.

BAELISH: You wouldnt risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?

CERSEI: And if you succeed?

BAELISH: Name me Warden of the North.

CERSEI: Ill speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.

BAELISH: Ill not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.

CERSEI: And Ill l know youre a man of your word when I see Sansa Starks head on a spike.

BAELISH: As I said. I live to serve.

EXT. DORNE - GARDEN

Trystane puts a flower in Myrcellas hair.

TRYSTANE: Im going to ask him tomorrow.

MYRCELLA: What if he says no?

TRYSTANE: He wont. Youve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?

MYRCELLA: Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you

Trystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence. Myrcella pushes him off.

MYRCELLA: We cant. Not yet.

TRYSTANE: Why not?

MYRCELLA: You know why not. Someone will see.

TRYSTANE: You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.

MYRCELLA: How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?

TRYSTANE: I like the way your eyes go squinty when youre jealous.

MYRCELLA: They dont go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.

Cut to Doran and Areo on the balcony.

DORAN: They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.

AREO: Yes, my prince.

DORAN: You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.

AREO: I remember how.

EXT. DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE

BRONN (singing): The Dornishmans wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishmans blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishmans wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...

JAIME: Alright, thats enough.

BRONN: Im coming to the best part.

JAIME: Were trying to blend in. We dont want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.

BRONN: This song really is all about the ending.

JAIME: It can wait. Up there.

He spots a line of Dornishmen walking towards the Water Gardens.

JAIME: Thats the Water Gardens.

BRONN: Once we got the princess, then what?

JAIME: I like to improvise.

BRONN: That explains the golden hand.

EXT. DORNE - WATER GARDENS

Jaime and Bronn ride in behind common folk carrying meat and other goods. They break off from the pack.

INT. SHADOWY ROOM

ELLARIA: Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.

SAND SNAKES: For Oberyn.

They storm towards the Water Gardens as Ellaria watches.

EXT. WATER GARDENS

Jamie and Bronn converge on Myrcella and Trystane as the Sand Snakes approach. They see the two kissing.

BRONN: Well, shes made herself at home.

They walk over.

JAIME: Myrcella.

They stop kissing.

MYRCELLA: Uncle Jaime? I dont understand, what are you doing here?

JAIME: Lets speak in private.

TRYSTANE: I am Trystane Martell.

MYRCELLA: Trystane is my intended.

JAIME: Excellent. Good to meet you.

Jaime shakes hands with Trystane with his good hand.

TRYSTANE: We werent expecting you, Ser Jaime.

Bronn advances.

BRONN: Why dont you let them have some time alone, son?

Trystane inspects Bronns armor, looking for a sigil.

BRONN: Lets not do something stupid.

Trystane reaches for his sword and Bronn punches him across the face, knocking him out.

MYRCELLA: No!

BRONN: That was something stupid.

JAIME: We have to go, Myrcella, now.

MYRCELLA: You hurt him!

JAIME: Youll be fine, I promise, but we have to--

A whip wraps around Jaimes wrist. The Sand Snakes are here.

BRONN: Oh for fucks sake.

The Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn, one wielding a spear, one wielding a whip, and one wielding a pair of daggers. They occupy Bronn and Jaime long enough for Obara to get to Myrcella.

OBARA: Youre coming with me.

MYRCELLA: I dont want to!

OBARA: I wasnt asking, princess.

Obara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronns arm open. Areo and his men meet Obara as she escapes.

AREO: Drop you weapons!

The rest of Areos men surround the Sand Snakes, Bronn, and Jaime.

OBARA: I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

AREO: Drop your weapons!

The Snakes drop their weapons. Jaime stares down Areo, sword still in hand. Areo puts his axe to Jaimes neck.

AREO: When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.

Jaime drops the sword, Areos men grab him. Bronn drops his sword.

BRONN (to Snake): You fight pretty good for a little girl.

She screams at Bronn and is restrained by Areos men. They are all escorted away. The rest of Areos men corner Elaria in the room outside the Gardens.

EXT. THE KINGSROAD

A carriage rides on the outskirts of Kings Landing.

RIDER: Halt!

Cut to inside the carriage.

OLENNA: Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.

EXT. KINGS LANDING - GARDEN

OLENNA: Rumors and gossip, thats all they got. Its theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in Kings Landing thered be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.

MARGAERY: Everyone knew about him and Renly.

OLENNA: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.

MARGAERY: But he was the kings brother.

OLENNA: And Loras is the queens brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.

MARGAERY: Cersei is behind this.

OLENNA: Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

INT. CERSEIS ROOM

Cersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna.

OLENNA: Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.

CERSEI: You must be exhausted.

OLENNA: Put the pen down, dear, we all know you arent writing anything.

CERSEI: Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.

OLENNA: And the famous tart Queen Cersei.

CERSEI: Beg your pardon.

OLENNA: I know youre behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

CERSEI: If you apologize for that comment perhaps--

OLENNA: Youll get your apology when I get Loras.

CERSEI: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?

OLENNA: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?

CERSEI: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--

OLENNA: Do you expect the alliance to continue after youve thrown our future into prison?

CERSEI: As I said, i didnt imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--

OLENNA: What veil?

CERSEI: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

OLENNA: I didnt trust your father. I didnt particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.

CERSEI: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which Im sure they dont. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and well forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.

INT. HIGH SEPTONS ROOM

HIGH SPARROW: You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?

LORAS: I dont pay attention to rumors.

SPARROW: You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis army closed in

LORAS: He was my friend. He was my king.

SPARROW: Wasnt Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.

LORAS: I was wrong to support Renlys claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.

SPARROW: Wearing Renlys armor.

LORAS: Why does it matter what I wore?

SPARROW: Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.

LORAS: Of course I deny them.

SPARROW: You never lay with Renly Baratheon.

LORAS: Never.

SPARROW: Nor any other man.

LORAS: Never.

SPARROW: That will be all Ser Loras.

Loras walks back to his seat.

OLENNA: Well I think thats quite enough of that.

SPARROW: Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

MARGAERY: You call me forward?

SPARROW: Yes. We have some questions for you.

MARGAERY: I am the queen.

SPARROW: You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.

Margaery walks to the stand.

SPARROW: How do you respond to these charges against your brother?

MARGAERY: They are lies.

SPARROW: All of them?

MARGAERY: All of them.

SPARROW: Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?

MARGAERY: Yes, I swear it.

SPARROW: Thank you, your grace.

The Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile.

SPARROW: Do you know this man?

OLYVAR: Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

SPARROW: How did you come to meet?

OLYVAR: I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.

SPARROW: And what occurred in his chamber?

OLYVAR: We engaged in intimate relations.

SPARROW: You laid with him?

OLYVAR: That night and many others.

LORAS: Liar! Hes a liar!

SPARROW: Is there anyone else who can support your claim?

OLYVAR: Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didnt seem surprised.

CERSEI: This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?

OLYVAR: He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.

Loras jumps at Olyvar and The Faith restrains him. Margaery and Olenna get up to leave and The Faith blocks their way.

LORAS: Liar!

OLENNA: What are you doing? Let us pass.

SPARROW: The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.

MARGAERY: What?

SPARROW: Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.

The Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.

MARGAERY: Tommen! Tommen!

King Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do.

MARGAERY: You cant do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!

Olenna glares at Cersei. Cersei smiles back.

INT. WINTERFELL - SANSAS CHAMBER

Sansa looks at herself in the mirror. She hears a knock and opens the door. It's Myranda.

SANSA: What do you want?

MYRANDA: Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband dont you?

Cut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansas hair.

MYRANDA: Youre so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.

SANSA: What others?

MYRANDA: I shouldnt gossip. Its good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.

SANSA: What others?

MYRANDA: Lets see. There was Kiera. The blacksmiths daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, dont they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

SANSA: Hunt?

MYRANDA: Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But its your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?

SANSA: What was your name again?

MYRANDA: Myranda.

SANSA: And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you cant frighten me.

MYRANDA: Are you done with your bath, my lady?

SANSA: Go. I can finish on my own.

EXT. SANSAS ROOM - MORNING

Snow falls outside. There is a knock on the door.

SANSA: Yes?

INT. SANSAS ROOM

Theon enters.

THEON: Ive come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?

SANSA: No.

THEON: Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

SANSA: Im not touching you.

THEON: Please. Hell punish me.

SANSA: Do you think I care what he does to you.

Sansa leaves the room without Theon.

EXT. THE GODSWOOD

Sansa walks to the Godswood with Theon. Ramsay is waiting alongside his father and with the Bolton men forming an aisle. Roose walks forward.

ROOSE: Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

THEON: Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?

Ramsay steps forward.

RAMSAY: Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?

THEON: Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was who was her fathers ward.

ROOSE: Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

Long pause. Cut to Ramsay, Walda, and Myranda. Sansa steps forward.

SANSA: I take this man.

Ramsay smiles.

INT. RAMSAYS CHAMBERS

Theon opens the door for Ramsay and Sansa.

RAMSAY: Are you pleased my lady?

Sansa nods.

RAMSAY: Good. I want you to be happy. My father said youre still a virgin.

SANSA: Yes.

RAMSAY: Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?

SANSA: Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.

RAMSAY: Youre not lying to me?

SANSA: No, my lord.

RAMSAY: Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, dont you think?

SANSA: Yes sir.

Ramsay kisses her.

RAMSAY: Good. Now take off your clothes.

Theon starts to leave.

RAMSAY: Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.

Sansa starts to undo her coat. Theon closes the door.

RAMSAY: Reek? I told you to watch.

Theon looks up.

RAMSAY: Youve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.

Ramsay rips Sansas coat open and pushes her onto the bed. We hear clothes ripping. A belt being undone. Sansa starts moaning. Close up on Theon crying.

END EPISODE
EXT. CASTLE BLACK

Men of the Nights Watch prepare the horses as snow falls on Castle Black. Thormund is brought before Jon. Jon looks at him, nods, and  a Brother removes Tormunds chains. Thormund raises his free hands to Ser Alliser in the distance and is carried away. Jon walks over to Alliser.

JON: First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.

ALLISER: Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.

Cut to Olly watching their conversation from afar.

JON: As always, thank you for your honesty.

Jon walks away to Sam.

SAM: Safe travels, Lord Commander.

JON: Thank you, Sam.

SAM: Oh, and

Sam hands him a wrapped package. Jon opens it to find a sword.

SAM: Its Dragonglass. Its what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you dont need them.

JON: Me too.

They hug. Jon gets on a horse next to Tormund and rides away.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - MAESTOR AEMONS ROOM

AEMON: There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.

Gilly looks at Sam, confused.

SAM: His little brother, Aegon. He became king.

AEMON: And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one.

Aemons mood changes, he suddenly becomes panicked.

AEMON: Get him south, Gillyflower. Before its too late.

INT. WINTERFELL - HALLWAY

Theon carries a food plate across the hall. He arrives at a door and unlocks it.

INT. SANSAS ROOM

Sansa is sleeping. Theon approaches and closes a window, waking Sansa.

SANSA: Theon, wait.

THEON: Not Theon, my lady. Reek.

Sansa sits up in bed, revealing cuts and bruises along her arms.

SANSA: Help me.

THEON: Youre his wife now.

SANSA: Theon

THEON: Do what he says. Do what he says or hell hurt you.

SANSA: He already hurts me every night. All day Im locked in this room and every night he comes. It cant be worse.

THEON: It can. It can always be worse.

Sansa stands up.

SANSA: What did he do to you?

THEON: Please

Theon goes for the door. Sansa runs to the door and blocks him from leaving.

SANSA: You betrayed my family!

THEON: Im sorry. Im sorry!

SANSA: You have to help me!

THEON: Hell see us. You dont know him.

SANSA: My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and theyll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.

THEON: Reek, my lady, Reek!

SANSA: Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.

Theon hesitates, nods, and exits the room.

EXT. WINTERFELL

Theon walks across Winterfell with the Broken Tower in the background.

INT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER

Theon climbs the stairs to the top floor. He opens the door to see Ramsay eating.

RAMSAY: Yes, Reek?

EXT. OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

Brienne stares at the top floor of the Broken Tower from beyond the walls of Winterfell.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - AEMONS ROOM

Close-up on a candle, then Gillys baby.

AEMON: Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!

GILLY: Get some sleep, Sam. Youll have to speak for him tomorrow.

SAM: You dont know that.

GILLY: Get some sleep. Ill watch over him.

SAM: Ill stay too. Hes always been good to me. I cant leave him now.

AEMON (panicked): Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old

EXT. CASTLE BLACK

Close up on Maester Aemons funeral pyre.

SAM: His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from Kings Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Nights Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.

BROTHERS: And now his watch has ended.

Sam lights the pyre, then hands the torch to Alliser, who lights it then passes it along.

ALLISER: Youre losing all your friends, Tarly.

Sam looks up to see a Brother glaring at him.

EXT. WINTERFELL

Sansa walks up to Ramsay.

RAMSAY: My beautiful wife.

He kisses her.

RAMSAY: When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? Youve made me very happy.

They start walking down stairs. Sansa grabs a cross in the snow before they leave.

RAMSAY: Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. Hes a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. Hes hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His armys out there now, suffering in the snow. One day Ill be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. Youll be my Lady and Wardeness.

SANSA: But isnt your step mother pregnant?

RAMSAY: What of it?

SANSA: What happens if she has a boy?

RAMSAY: Then Ill have a baby brother.

SANSA: But hell be the heir.

RAMSAY: Im Lord Boltons eldest son.

SANSA: But youre a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.

Ramsay stops walking.

RAMSAY: Ive been naturalized by a royal decree of--

SANSA: Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.

They start walking again.

RAMSAY: Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch.

Sansa looks shocked.

RAMSAY: You didnt know? Yes, hes done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.

EXT. WINTERFELL

The woman who visited Sansas chamber previously is out in the open, flayed to death.

RAMSAY: Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.

Cut to Theon looking terrified.

RAMSAY: Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.

Sansa continues to look at the woman, horrified.

RAMSAY: Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. Its far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.

He kisses her on the cheek then she is carried away.

EXT. STANNIS CAMP

Davos rides through the camp on horseback, observing the men as they cough and huddle around each other. The snow is falling hard.

INT. STANNIS CAMP - STANNIS TENT

DAVOS: 40 horses died in the night. Well lose more come sunset. Were running out of food. We cant open the supply line until the snow clears.

STANNIS: What else?

DAVOS: The Stormcrows rode off last night.

STANNIS: 500 men.

Davos nods. Stannis removes a Baratheon piece from his chess board.

STANNIS: Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.

DAVOS: We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we wont be marching anywhere in this weather.

STANNIS: And?

DAVOS: This isnt our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.

STANNIS: I retreated from Kings Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become The King Who Ran.

DAVOS: Your Grace..

STANNIS: Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, its a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.

DAVOS: Its better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.

STANNIS: This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, weve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,

Davos looks to Melisandre, lurking in the back of the tent.

DAVOS: Your Grace. (leaves)

STANNIS (to Melisandre): Ive trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.

MELISANDRE: You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.

STANNIS: I dont know what I saw.

MELISANDRE: You do know. Trust yourself.

STANNIS: And you, do you trust yourself?

MELISANDRE: I trust in the Lord.

STANNIS: Are you sure?

MELISANDRE: I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.

She flips the Bolton pieces over on Stannis board.

MELISANDRE: But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

STANNIS: We dont have Roberts bastard here.

MELISANDRE: No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.

STANNIS: Have you lost your mind?

MELISANDRE: Do you doubt me still? After all that youve seen?

STANNIS: There must be another way. Leeches or something.

MELISANDRE: There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.

STANNIS: Shes my daughter.

Melisandre embraces him.

STANNIS: Get out.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - WASH ROOM

Gilly washes clothes. Two Brothers walk into the room.

DERRYK: The beauty from beyond The Wall.

Gilly starts walking away.

BRAND: Where are you going, huh? Arent we better looking than the fat man?

DERRYK: The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because shes the only girl here?

BRAND: Even in White Harbor, Id want a kiss.

DERRYK: Come on love, give us a kiss.

GILLY: Leave me alone.

DERRYK: If you were my girl I wouldnt leave you alone.

BRAND: One little kiss.

DERRYK: Come on, give him a kiss.

BRAND: A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

She tries to walk away. They slap the laundry basket out of her hands and trap her.

BRAND: Theres no need to be rude.

DERRYK: We just want a little affection.

She slaps Derryk across the face. Sam enters the room and pulls out his sword.

SAM: Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

BRAND: Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?

DERRYK: Look at his hands shaking.

SAM: Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.

Derryk throws her to the floor.

SAM: Im warning you.

DERRYK: Come on! Come on!

Sam swings the sword. It is deflected and he is subdued. Derryk punches him in the gut then starts kicking him.

DERRYK: You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) Hes your hero. Hes a hog!

GILLY: Leave him alone!

She charges at Derryk. He subdues her.

DERRYK: Stubborn little wilding bitch arent ya?

Brand kicks Sam in the face.

GILLY: Sam! Sam! Sam!

He punches Sam repeatedly in the face until he seems to lose consciousness.

BRAND: Alright. Hold still.

They both hold Gilly down as she screams. Sam gets back up.

SAM: I said get your hands off her.

BRAND: Youre gonna get yourself killed.

DERRYK: Roll over. Jon Snows not here to save you.

SAM: I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. Ill take my chances with you.

Ghost shows up and growls at the brothers. They sprint out of the room. Sam falls to his knees.

GILLY: Sam!

SAM: Im alright.

GILLY: Youre not.

SAMMY: Just a bit woozy.

Sam collapses onto his side.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - BEDROOM

Gilly washes out Sams wounds with a wash cloth.

GILLY: The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.

SAM: I will not. They wouldve I dont know what they would have done

GILLY: I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadnt come.

SAM: No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.

GILLY: Dont be stupid Sam, youre not a fighter.

SAM: What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?

GILLY: Just promise me that whatever happens youll take care of little Sam.

SAM: Of course I will. And Ill take care of you, too.

GILLY: I need more water.

She gets up. Sam grabs her arm.

SAM: Stay. Please.

Gilly gets on top of Sam and starts kissing him. She gets back up, and puts her hands around his neck and starts kissing him again.

GILLY: Am I hurting you?

He shakes his head no.

GILLY: Are you sure?

Sam nods yes. She pulls his pants down, pulls her dress up, and starts riding him.

SAM: Oh. Oh my.

EXT. VOLANTIS - SLAVERS AUCTION

The slaves are carried up to the auction stage. One of Malkos men whips Tyrion.

MALKO: A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This ones a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

A hand goes up.

MALKO: 13. Do I have 14?

A hand goes up.

MALKO: 15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?

A man in the front who has been studying Jorah intently raises his hand.

SLAVE BUYER: 20.

MALKO: Sold!

Jorah is taken away.

TYRION: Wait! You have to buy me as well.

BUYER: Why?

TYRION: Were a team. Im a great fighter, too.

The crowd laughs.

MALKO: Hes funny. You have to give him that.

The man holding Tyrions chains laughs at him. Tyrion yanks his chains, pulling the man to the ground, and starts beating on him with the chains as the crowd roars. Tyrion kicks him in the head then looks to the buyer.

BUYER: Alright. Hes funny.

He hands Malko coins.

TYRION: Thank you my Lord. Thank you.

BUYER: Yes.

TYRION: My Lord, if I may. Ive heard Mereens become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage

The buyer hits Tyrion in the mouth then tosses him a few coins.

BUER: Heres your wages, funny man. Itll last the rest of your life.

INT. MEREEN - DAENERYS CHAMBER

DAARIO: How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?

DAENERYS: Dont be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think hes smart enough to understand that.

DAARIO: I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.

DAENERYS: Are you jealous?

DAARIO: Do you think Im petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?

DAENERYS: I do.

Daario laughs.

DAARIO: Youre right. My motivations are entirely impure.

They start kissing.

DAARIO: Doesnt make me wrong.

DAENERYS: You told me yourself, I cant fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.

DAARIO: Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.

DAENERYS: So what else can I do?

DAARIO: Marry me instead.

DAENERYS: Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldnt.

DAARIO: Why not? Youre our queen, you can do as you like.

DAENERYS: No. I cant

DAARIO: Then you are the only person in Mereen whos not free.

Daenerys sits up in bed.

DAARIO: I know Im here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?

DAENERYS: Of course

DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.

DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.

DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.

INT. KINGS LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

OLENNA: You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name hes got.

HIGH SPARROW: Its not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, Ill admit.

OLENNA: You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.

SPARROW: You should have the decency to kneel before the gods

OLENNA: Dont spar with me little fellow.

The High Septon gets up.

SPARROW: For me, its the knees. You?

OLENNA: Hips.

SPARROW: Huh.

OLENNA: A man of the people, is that your game? Its an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cerseis dirty work for her.

SPARROW: The people always do the dirty work.

OLENNA: Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

SPARROW: A useful talent.

OLENNA: Im here for my grandson and granddaughter.

SPARROW: Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.

The High Sparrow heads for the door.

OLENNA: Dont you walk away from me.

SPARROW: You dont give commands here, Lady Olenna.

OLENNA: What is it you want? Gold? Ill make you the richest septon who ever lived.

The High Sparrow laughs.

OLENNA: What then?

SPARROW: I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But Im telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.

OLENNA: How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?

SPARROW: By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you dont have one in your library Ill give you my own.

OLENNA (with contempt): Ive read the seven pointed star.

SPARROW: Then youll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

OLENNA: Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?

SPARROW: Yes. The Gods laws must be applied to all equally.

OLENNA: If its equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And Ill make sure the hungry know who to blame,

SPARROW: Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few

He walks out of the room.

EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR

SQUIRE: Lady Olenna.

He hands her a letter with Baelish's mockingbird sigil.

INT. KINGS LANDING - DINING ROOM

CERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.

TOMMEN: Shes in a prison cell and theres nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and theres nothing I can do!

Tommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.

CERSEI: No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.
Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

TOMMEN: Ill call in the army. Ill take back the sept and kill every last one of them. Ill start a war if I have to.

CERSEI: You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.

TOMMEN: I love her. I love her. I cant help her.

CERSEI: We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.

TOMMEN: I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--

CERSEI: Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

CERSEI: Your happiness is all I want in this world

TOMMEN: I know.

CERSEI: No you dont. You cant possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.

Cersei embraces him and starts crying.

INT. DORNE

Jaime is being kept in a closely monitored room.

AREO: Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princesss wellbeing.

Areo brings Myrcella into the room.

MYRCELLA: You looked different when I left. You had more hair.

JAIME: And more hands. Hows Trystane?

MYRCELLA: Hell be alright.

JAIME: Im sorry for that. It wasnt supposed to happen that way.

MYRCELLA: Why is it happening at all?

JAIME: Your mothers worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. Ive come to take you home.

MYRCELLA: This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didnt want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now shes forcing me to go back?

JAIME: It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.

MYRCELLA: Its not complicated at all, its simple. I love Trystane, Im going to marry him, and were staying right here.

JAIME: I dont understand.

MYRCELLA: Of course you dont! You dont know me!

Myrcella leaves the room.

INT. DORNE - CELL

BRONN (singing): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishmans taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and Ive tasted the Dornishmans wife! Yes Ive tasted the Dornishmans wife!

In the adjacent cell to Bronn, Tyene claps as the other Snakes glare at her.

TYENE: Hes got a good voice.

OBARA: Were lucky hes a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.

BRONN: Its against my code to hurt a woman.

OBARA: Its amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.

BRONN: I wouldnt say you beat me.

TYENE: Hows your arm?

BRONN: Wonderful. Wouldnt feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.

TYENE: You think youre leaving Dorne?

BRONN: No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.

TYENE: Thank you.

BRONN: I said Dornish women. I didnt say you.

TYENE: Im not the most beautiful woman youve ever seen?

BRONN: Ive seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.

TYENE: Name one more beautiful than I am.

BRONN: Well now, in Kings Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...

Tyene takes one of her breasts out of her tunic.

TYENE: There was a what? In Kings Landing you were saying.

BRONN: Was I?

TYENE: There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

Tyene takes both her breasts out.

BRONN: Was there? My memorys not what it was earlier.

TYENE: Hows your arm now?

BRONN: You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.

Tyene undoes the rest of her tunic.

TYENE: And how about your head?

BRONN: My head You dont even wanna know whats going on in

As Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground.

TYENE: Your nose is bleeding.

BRONN: Its nothing. Its the dry air.

TYENE: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.

She holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell.

TYENE: The only antidote. Whos the most beautiful woman in the world?

Bronn gasps for breath.

TYENE: Sorry? Who?

BRONN (finally): You.

TYENE: Dont drop it.

Tyene tosses it into his cell and Bronn downs it.

TYENE: I think youre very handsome as well.

INT. KINGS LANDING - BAELISHS BROTHEL

Littlefinger peers at the Great Sept of Baelor through the window. The brothel is destroyed, with many seven-pointed stars scribbled on the floor, walls, and artwork.

BAELISH: Im sorry about the locale.

OLENNA: No youre not.

BAELISH: It felt like the safest place.

OLENNA: Not for your clientele, clearly.

BAELISH: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didnt exist until we invented them.

OLENNA: Youve always been rather impressed with yourself, havent you?

BAELISH: The past is the past. The future is all thats worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.

OLENNA: Dont pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known youd return to the capital once things started going wrong.

BAELISH: I promise you..

OLENNA: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, theyll never even find whats left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?

BAELISH: Cersei summoned me to Kings Landing. I dared not refuse her.

OLENNA: And what did she want?

BAELISH: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.

OLENNA: What kind of gift?

BAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.

INT. MEREEN - FIGHTING PITS - WAITING AREA

Gladiators prepare their swords and armor.

SLAVE OWNER: Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something.

Close-up on Jorah.

OWNER (O.S.): You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you.

Jorah is not one of the gladiators selected.

OWNER: Valar morghulis.

MEN: Valar dohaeris.

OWNER: Prepare yourselves.

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

DAENERYS: Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.

HIZDAHR: For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.

The fighters enter the pit.

OWNER: Move yourselves!

The slave owner sees Daenerys and runs in front of her and Hizdahr.

OWNER: Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.

The owner gets all his gladiators to face Dany, whispering instructions to them.

OWNER: We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.

MEN: We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.

The fight begins

INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA

Jorah hears O glorious queen and runs to the edge of the pit. He sees Daenerys through the grated entrance to the ring.

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

One bald gladiator dominates the pit. He slits one fighters throat, and slices another fighters leg as he runs away.

DAENERYS: I think Ive seen enough.

HIZDAHR: Your Grace, its a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.

DAENERYS: Ive sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.

INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA

Jorah straps a helmet on.

TYRION: What are you doing?

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

Jorah rushes the pit. His owner tries to stop him but he knocks him out with the butt of his sword. Jorah takes out the bald man as he was smashing a mans head in with a rock. Daenerys takes notice of the fighter but cant see his face.

INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA

The other gladiators that werent chosen to fight follow Jorahs lead and enter the ring. Tyrion tries but is chained up. He starts sawing at his chain.

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

Jorah melees a fighter with a shield, then knocks another out with his own helmet.

INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA

A giant man sees Tyrion sawing at his chains. He raises a giant sword above Tyrions head, but comes down on the chain, freeing Tyrion. Tyrion nods in thanks.

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

Daenerys is watching intently now. Jorah is the last man standing. He walks up to Daenerys and Hizdahr and removes his helmet. She stares at him for a moment.

DAENERYS: Get him out of my sight.

Her men grab Jorah.

JORAH: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.

TYRION (O.S.): Its true. He has.

Tyrion enters the pit.

DAENERYS: Who are you?

TYRION: I am the gift. Its a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.

Cut to Dany in shock and deep thought after hearing his name.

INT. KINGS LANDING - BLACK CELL

Cersei enters Margaerys cell.

CERSEI: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. Its quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.

MARGAERY: I know you did this.

CERSEI: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.

MARGAERY: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? Youre not very good at those, Im afraid. Perhaps thats why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.

CERSEI: Youre upset. Youre not thinking clearly. Ill visit again when youve had a chance to calm down.

MARGAERY: I dont want to see you again.

CERSEI: I do hope you change your mind about that. Ive been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.

MARGAERY: Leave.

CERSEI: Yes, Im afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.

Margaery throws the medicine at Cersei.

MARGAERY: Get out you hateful bitch!

CERSEI: Sleep well, sister.

Cersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septons room by a Sparrow.

INT. GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL

HIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?

CERSEI: Yes.

SPARROW: And?

CERSEI: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?

SPARROW: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.

CERSEI: Who will stand judge?

SPARROW: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.

CERSEI: Will you be one of them?

SPARROW: I will.

CERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial

SPARROW: Then they will be at The Mothers mercy.

CERSEI: What does The Mothers mercy entail?

SPARROW: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

CERSEI: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.

SPARROW: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in Kings Landing?

CERSEI: I think I may have heard at one point.

SPARROW: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.

The High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.

SPARROW: Who carved this altar do you know?

CERSEI: Im afraid i dont.

SPARROW: No one does. Theres no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didnt inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.

Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrells finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery?

The High Septon stares intently at Cersei.

SPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.

Cersei gives a faint laugh.

SPARROW: And he has much to say about you.

Lancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.

CERSEI: Move. Let me go immediately.

Cersei is grabbed and carried away from the room.

CERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy I am the queen! Let me go!

INT. BLACK CELL

Cersei is thrown into the cell. She looks up at the people who put her there.

CERSEI: Look at me. Look at my face. Its the last thing youll see before you die.

The door slams closed and is bolted shut.

END EPISODE
INT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID

JORAH: Your Grace, I want to say--

DAENERYS: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?

TYRION: If only I were otherwise.

DAENERYS: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldnt I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine

TYRION: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

DAENERYS: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?

TYRION: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. Its too soon to know if you deserve my service.

DAENERYS: If youd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.

TYRION: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.

DAENERYS: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?

TYRION: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.

DAENERYS: I have a very large army and very large dragons.

TYRION: Killing and politics arent always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.

DAENERYS: So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

TYRION: I know.

DAENERYS: Why should the people trust a queen who cant keep her promises?

TYRION: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I cant remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.

Tyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei. Her guards raise their spears to her. Daenerys waves them off.

TYRION: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?

DAENERYS: Yes, many opportunities.

TYRION: And did he?

DAENERYS: No. Not until forced to do so.

TYRION: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.

DAENERYS: So I should kill him?

TYRION: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And youre going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if youre ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.

DAENERYS: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

Daenerys and Jorah hold back tears. Jorah is escorted out of the Pyramid. Jorah checks his Greyscale and walks away.

INT. BLACK CELLS

The Septa holds water out to Cersei.

SEPTA: Confess.

CERSEI: My son. Let me speak to--

She slaps Cersei with a spoon.

SEPTA: Confess. I meant it.

CERSEI: My face will be the last thing you see before--

She slaps her with a spoon again then leaves. Cersei starts screaming.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

ARYA: My name is Lana. Im an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.

CUT TO: EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET

Arya pushes an oyster cart through a crowded market.

ARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--

CUT TO: INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

Jaqen slaps her.

ARYA: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.

JAQEN: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.

ARYA: How will she serve him?

JAQEN: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

ARYA: What will she do there?

JAQEN: She will see.

ARYA: See what?

JAQEN: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.

ARYA: Oysters, clams and cockles!

Arya takes a right with the cart.

ARYA: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!

THIN MAN: Your oysters fresh?

ARYA: Best in the city.

THIN MAN: You wouldnt lie to an old man would you?

Arya cracks an oyster and hands him one he slurps it.

THIN MAN: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.

A man throws a bag of money and a map on the Thin Mans table.

MAN: Its my 18th voyage. Ive returned from all of them without a scratch on me.

THIN MAN: Cant do it.

MAN: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You dont understand?

He is carried away as the Thin Man slurps the oyster

CUT TO: INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

JAQEN: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.

ARYA: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?

JAQEN: A girl tells a man that she has seen.

ARYA: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

JAQEN: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesnt have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?

Arya looks to see a man praying on the floor.

ARYA: The Many Faced God. You said you didnt know what I would see at the docks.

JAQEN: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.

ARYA: And then what?

JAQEN: A gift for the Thin Man.

He holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile, smiling.

WAIF: She is not ready.

JAQEN: Perhaps she is, perhaps shes not.

WAIF: And if shes not?

JAQEN: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.

INT. BLACK CELLS

Qyburn enters the cell and bows.

QYBURN: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.

CERSEI: The charges?

QYBURN: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.

CERSEI: All lies.

QYBURN: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope youll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.

CERSEI: I wish youd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?

QYBURN: Im afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.

CERSEI: Tell him I need to speak to him.

QYBURN: I implored him to visit you but he would not.

CERSEI: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--

QYBURN: Your arrest, and Queen Margaerys arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.

CERSEI: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.

QYBURN: I tried my grace, he wouldnt see me. He wouldnt see anyone.

CERSEI: I cant stay here.

QYBURN: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.

CERSEI: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I wont. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.

The septa enters the room.

QYBURN: Goodbye my queen. The work continues.

Qyburn leaves the cell.

INT. WINTERFELL - SANSAS CHAMBER

Theon enters Sansas room and sets food down.

SANSA: Why. Why Theon.

THEON: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.

SANSA: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?

THEON: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.

SANSA: Good. If it werent for you Id still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.

THEON: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.

THEON: They werent those boys, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, youd know them since they were born.

THEON: They werent. They were only--

SANSA: Only what?

THEON: I cant..

SANSA: Tell me!

THEON: I cant, not unless the master says...

SANSA: Tell me, they werent what?!

THEON: They werent...

SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they werent your brothers!

THEON: They werent Bran and Rickon! I couldnt find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.

SANSA: You didnt?

Theon shakes his head no.

SANSA: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?

THEON: I cant talk to you anymore.

SANSA: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--

THEON: Not Theon, Reek!

Theon runs out the door.

INT. WINTERFELL - HALL

BOLTON BANNERMAN: Our scouts tells us hes got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.

ROOSE: And how high can Stannis horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

Ramsay gives a disagreeing look.

ROOSE: You disagree?

RAMSAY: Stannis isnt from the North. You are, father. I think youre missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

ROOSE: And what do you recommend?

RAMSAY: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.

ROOSE: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they cant touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldnt get an army through if we wanted to.

RAMSAY: I dont need an army. I need 20 good men.

INT. MEEREEN

DAENERYS: So have you decided yet? Whether Im worthy of your service?

TYRION: Have you decided yet whether youre going to have me killed?

DAENERYS: Its probably my safest option.

TYRION: I can see why you would think so. Its what your father would have done.

DAENERYS: And what would your father do?

TYRION: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? Id say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.

DAENERYS: Is that why you killed him?

TYRION: Some day if you decide not to execute me, Ill tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, well need more wine than this.

DAENERYS: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.

TYRION: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

DAENERYS: Im terrible?

TYRION: Ive heard stories.

DANERYS: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?

TYRION: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.

DAENERYS: Which kind is that?

TYRION: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.

DAENERYS: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.

TYRION:  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.

DAENERYS: Perhaps it wont come to that.

TYRION: Its not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.

DAENERYS: Varys? King Roberts spy master?

TYRION: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

DAENERYS: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

TYRION: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didnt have to do. I suspect hes the main reason you werent slaughtered in your crib.

DAENERYS: But you trust him?

TYRION: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.

DAENERYS: The brother who killed my father.

TYRION: Thats the one.

DAENERYS: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

TYRION: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.

DAENERYS: Im not going to kill you.

TYRION: No? Banish me?

DAENERYS: No.

TYRION: So if Im not going to be murdered, and Im not going to be banished...

DAENERYS: Youre going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.

TYRION: Advise you on what?

DAENERYS: How to get what I want.

TYRION: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.

DAENERYS: If I want jokes Ill get myself a proper fool.

TYRION: Im not entirely joking. Theres more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.

DAENERYS: I fought so that no child born into Slavers Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.

TYRION: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?

DAENERYS: The common people.

TYRION: Lets be generous and assume thats going to happen. Here in Slavers Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters wont back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon wont back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.

DAENERYS: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. Theyre all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.

TYRION: Its a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. Youre not the first person to have dreamt it.

DAENERYS: Im not going to stop the wheel. Im going to break the wheel.

EXT. FIGHTING PIT

Two gladiators spar. Jorah walks to the pit. The master whistles for them to stop fighting. Jorah flips him a coin.

JORAH: You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.

MASTER: You struck me.

JORAH: Ive been flogged if it makes you happy. Im the best youve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?

MASTER: Youre a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?

JORAH: Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

INT. BLACK CELLS

SEPTA: Thirsty? Confess.

CERSEI: Ill get out of here, you realize. Before long.

SEPTA: Confess.

CERSEI: I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.

SEPTA: Confess.

CERSEI: I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.

She dumps her water out on the floor. Cersei licks it from the floor when she leaves.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - SAMS ROOM

GILLY: Does it hurt?

SAM: No.

GILLY: Good.

SAM: How are you?

GILLY: Im not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.

SAM: You know what I mean.

GILLY: Im good.

SAM: Are you scared?

GILLY: A little.

SAM: Me too.

There is a knock on the door. Sam grabs his knife.

SAM: Whos there?

OLLY: Olly.

Sam puts the knife down.

SAM: Come in.

OLLY: I heard what happened.

SAM: Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. Its only natural.

Olly sets a tray of food on Sams bed.

OLLY: Figured you were hungry.

SAM: Youre a good lad.

OLLY: Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If youve got the time.

GILLY: I need to check on baby Sam.

She exits the room.

SAM: Now then. How can I help?

OLLY: Its about the Lord Commander.

SAM: Yes?

OLLY: Hes going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.

SAM: Weve been fighting them for years.

OLLY: This wasnt a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So whys he saving them?

SAM: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.

OLLY: The one hes travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.

SAM: Olly...

OLLY: How can he trust him?

SAM: Ive seen the army of the dead. Ive seen the white walkers, and theyre coming for us, for all the living. And when its time well need every last man we can find.

OLLY: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?

SAM: Jons taking a risk, but he has to. We dont stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.

OLLY: You believe that?

SAM: With all my heart.

Olly looks conflicted. He walks towards the door.

SAM: Try not to worry Olly. Ive been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

The ships full of Crows and wildlings dock at Hardhome. Jon and Tormund get out together. The camera fixates on the swords on their hips.

TORMUND: You trust me Jon Snow?

JON: Does that make me a fool?

TORMUND: We are fools together now.

They walk to meet the men and women of Hardhome, lead by the Lord of Bones.

TORMUND: Lord of Bones. Been a long time.

LORD OF BONES: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?

TORMUND: War.

LORD OF BONES: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.

TORMUND: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.

LORD OF BONES: You dont give the orders here.

TORMUND: Im not giving an order.

LORD OF BONES: Why arent you in chains?

JON: Hes not my prisoner.

LORD OF BONES: What is he?

JON: Were allies.

The Hardhome wildlings complain loudly.

LORD OF BONES: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.

TORMUND: I dont fight for the crows.

JON: Were not here to fight. Were here to talk.

LORD OF BONES: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when youre done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--

Tormund grabs the Lord of Bones staff from him and beats him to death with it.

TORMUND: Gather the elders and lets talk.

INT. HARDHOME - CABIN

Jon is surrounded by Karsi, a Wildling chieftess, Loboda, a Thenn, a Wildling elder, and various other Wildlings.

JON: My names Jon Snow. Im Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. Were not friends. Weve never been friends. We wont become friends today. This isnt about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and whats out there.

KARSI: You built that wall to keep us out.

LOBODA: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?

JON: In normal times we wouldnt. But these arent normal times. The white walkers dont care if a mans Free Folk or Crow. Were all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.

KARSI: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

Jon holds the bag full of Dragonstone to Karsi. She looks at it hesitantly.

JON: Its not a trick. Its a gift for those who join us.

Karsi examine the glass in shock.

JON: Dragonglass. A man of the Nights Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.

LOBODA: You saw this?

JON: No. But I trust the man.

KARSI: There are old stories about Dragonglass.

LOBODA: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.

KARSI: And with the things weve seen you dont believe them?

JON: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

KARSI: Come with you where?

JON: There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.

There is hesitation.

JON: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Nights Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. Were prepared to give you that new life.

KARSI: If?

JON: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.

LOBODA: Where is Mance?

JON: He died.

LOBODA: How?

JON (after a long pause): I put an arrow through his heart.

The wildlings in the cabin start to riot.

LOBODA: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.

Loboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.

TORMUND: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunts orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and thats what we need today: the courage to make peace with men weve been fighting for generations.

KARSI: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.

JON: Im not asking you to forget your dead. Ill never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But Im asking you to think about your children now. Theyll never have children of their own if we dont band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk cant stop them. The Nights Watch cant stop them. And all the southern kings cant stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then well give the fuckers a fight.

There are small nods of approval throughout the room.

KARSI: You vouch for this man, Tormund?

TORMUND: Hes prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. Hes young, but he knows how to lead. He didnt have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.

LOBODA: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.

KARSI: So would mine, but fuck 'em, theyre dead.

Karsi walks in front of Jon.

Ill never trust a man in black.

Karsi walks over to Tormund.

But I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, were with you.

TORMUND: This is the way.

WILDLING ELDER: Im with Tormund. We stay here were dead men. At least with King Crow theres a chance.

GIANT: Tormund.

LOBODA: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships theyre gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. Thats our enemy. That has always been our enemy.

Wildlings start leaving the cabin and head towards the boats.

KARSI (to Tormund): I fucking hate Thenns.

Tormund nods.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

Jon, Tormund, and Karsi lead the Wildlings to the boats.

JON: How many are with us? 5000?

TORMUND: Im not good at counting.

JON: Were leaving too many behind.

TORMUND: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.

JON: And he knew them better than I ever will.

TORMUND: Theyre running out of food and theres nothing to hunt. Theyll come around.

Cut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.

KARSI: Johnna is gonna look after you. Shes in charge, you listen to her.

DAUGHTER: I wanna go with you.

KARSI: I need to get the old folks on the boats. Im right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on.

INT. HARDHOME - CABIN

The Giant picks up a piece of Dragonglass and strokes it intently. Edd begins picking up the pieces of glass and looks at the giant with his piece of glass. Wun Wun turns to Edd and stares at him annoyed.

WUN WUN: Lokh kif rukh?

Edd leaves. Dogs are barking outside.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

Jon loads girls onto a boat then turns to hear the dogs barking. The wind starts whipping from a neighboring cliff and the dogs start whimpering. Every wildling and Crow slowly turns to the source of the noise.

EXT. HARDHOME - GATE

LOBODA: Shut the gate.

Men hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.

LOBODA: Shut the gate!!

Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.

SHOUTING: Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!

Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance, then a wight charges at the hole in the wall.

LOBODA: Ready your arrows!

The wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

There is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.

JON: Get in line! Get in line!

EXT. HARDHOME - GATE

A wight tries to climb the gate.

INT. HARDHOME - CABIN

Wights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls.

EXT. HARDHOME - GATE

One wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

The people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them.

JON: Hold the line! Hold the line!

NIGHTS WATCH BROTHER: Lord Commander!

JON: Get them to the ship and come back for me!

BROTHER: But youll never make it--

JON: Now!

Karsi approaches Jon.

JON: You should be on one of those boats.

KARSI: So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if youre not there ?

JON: You have my word. Ive given orders.

KARSI: Dont think youre gonna be there to enforce those orders !

Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.

TORMUND: If they get through, everyone dies !

JON: Nights Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!

Jon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Nights Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

The wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate.

Jon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled.

Fighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights.

Jon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff.

JON: The Dragonglass!

LOBODA: Youre with me, lad! Now!

Jon and Loboda charge towards the cabin. Jon cuts a wight in half then kills another. The giant breaks through a wall in the cabin as the cabin starts to go down in flames. He shakes the wights off of his back, snapping some in half and stomping others into pieces. Jon and Loboda storm the cabin.

INT. HARDHOME - CABIN

The entire cabin is on fire. A White Walker wielding a staff walks towards them through the fire.

LOBODA: Get the glass.

Loboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice, getting it caught in the wall. He pulls it out to parry in time, but the Walkers spear shatters his axe. The Walker plunges his spear through Loboda's stomach.

Jon reaches the glass but is thrown across the room by the Walker before he can pick it up, causing Longclaw to fly out of the cabin. Jon ducks from the Walkers swings with his spear, and runs out to grab another sword. The Walker swings and shatters the sword. He knocks Jon down again. Jon struggles, then gets up again, running to pick up Longclaw. He stumbles and drops the sword. The White Walker staggers towards him. Jon picks up Longclaw just in time to match the White Walker, and to both of their surprises, Longclaw stops the Walkers spear. The Walker deflects one blow from Jon, but then he swings and shatters the Walker into pieces.

Jon falls to the ground after the struggle. The Nights King watches him alone from the top of the cliff.

EXT. HARDHOME - GATE

Tormund and Karsi continue to tear through wights. Karsi looks up, and sees a group of blue-eyed wight children staring at her. They do nothing for a moment, then charge at her, chewing and clawing her to death.

Cut to Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons.

JON: The Dragonglass!

EDD: Fuck the glass! Were gonna die here.

A screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing, but then wake up and charge at Jon and Edd.

Cut to Tormund continuing to hold the gate. The gate starts creaking then comes down. Tormund runs to the boat.

The giant starts roaring as the other gate comes down, swinging a fiery log. Jon, Tormund, and Edd sprint towards the boat with the giant clearing a path for them with the log. The Nights King continues to watch them from the top of the cliff.

EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE

Jon, Tormund, and the Crow jump off the dock onto the boat.

JON: Go! Go! Go!

TORMUND: Wun Wun, to the sea.

The giant stays back, continuing to take out loads of wights by swinging his flaming log. He begins to walk towards the boat, ripping the wights hanging onto him off of his back and throwing them into the water to die.

JON: Lets go now! Now!

Jon looks back to shore to see the Wights, along with a White Walker, killing the last surviving wildlings.

Slowly, a figure walks to the end of the dock. The camera pans up to reveal the Nights King. He stares at Jon and Jon stares back. The Nights King turns his head to the carnage at the edge of the shore and then looks back to Jon. He slowly starts raising his arms.The dead wildlings twitch, then open their eyes to reveal blue. Karsii comes back to life, blue-eyed . They all start standing up, joining the army of the dead, and staring at Jon. Jon can do nothing but stare back at the Nights King back as the boat drifts away.

END EPISODE
EXT. STANNIS CAMP - NIGHT

A man walks by each of the tents.

INT. MELISANDRES TENT

Melisandre stares into the fire. She exits the tent.

EXT. STANNIS CAMP - NIGHT

Melisandre surveys the camp. In the distance, a tent catches on fire. Men start screaming and rushing out of their tents. A burning horse runs by Melisandre.

EXT. STANNIS CAMP - MORNING

DAVOS: A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--

STANNIS: Horses?

DAVOS: Were still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.

STANNIS: 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?

DAVOS: The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.

STANNIS: Put last nights guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.

DAVOS: Unless theres a thaw, we cant press forward to Winterfell, and we dont have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.

STANNIS: Were not returning to Castle Black.

DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we cant march forward, and we wont march back

Stannis looks to Melisandre and Selyse. Davos follows his gaze then looks back.

STANNIS: Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

Stannis walks over to Melisandre.

EXT. THE WALL

The Hardhome survivors, led by Jon, Tormund, Tollett, and Wun-Wun, approach the wall. Alliser looks down at the group. Jon steps forward, Alliser stares for a moment, then--

ALLISER: Open the gates.

The lower gate is lifted.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK

The Hardhome Wildlings are being escorted through Castle Black.

JON: It was a failure.

SAM: It wasnt.

JON: I went to save them, I failed.

SAM: You didnt fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.

JON: I dont think that facts lost on them.

Cut to many men of the Nights Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon.

ALLISER: You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.

INT. STANNIS TENT

Stannis is studying his chessboard. There are 2 Baratheon pieces next to a sword and opposed to 2 Bolton pieces. Davos enters the tent.

DAVOS: You sent for me, Your Grace.

STANNIS: Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, Im sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne Ill make sure the Nights Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.

DAVOS: Your Grace, youve named me your Hand.

STANNIS: Yes.

DAVOS: The Kings Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.

STANNIS: Youre not abandoning me, youre obeying a command.

DAVOS: A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.

STANNIS: And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didnt name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, dont come back empty handed.

DAVOS: Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

STANNIS: My family stays with me.

DAVOS: At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.

STANNIS: My family stays with me.

EXT. STANNIS CAMP

The men are shivering, waiting in line for food. Davos walks by.

INT. SHIREENS TENT

Shireen is reading one of her books. Davos enters.

DAVOS: Whats this one now?

SHIREEN: "The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling" by Grand Maester Munkun.

DAVOS: Well that sounds like a proper story.

SHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.

DAVOS: But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.

SHIREEN: And burnt him to a crisp.

Davos and Shireen share a laugh.

DAVOS: Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.

Davos hands her a stag carved out of wood.

DAVOS: Do you like it?

SHIREEN: Hes beautiful.

Shireen kisses him on the cheek.

SHIREEN: Thank you.

DAVOS: Youre very welcome.

SHIREEN: Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?

DAVOS: Of course I will.

SHIREEN: But why am I getting a present?

DAVOS: Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) Ill be gone for a few days, Princess. Ill want to hear all about the dance of dragons when Im back.

SHIREEN: Youll just have to read it yourself.

Davos kisses Shireen on her forehead then leaves. Shireen looks over the stag.

INT. DORNE - PALACE

Jaime is escorted by Areo to Dorans room.

JAIME: Prince Doran. (bows)

DORAN: Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.

JAIME: Princess Myrcella.

MYRCELLA: Uncle.

JAIME: What a lovely dress.

MYRCELLA: You dont like it?

JAIME: You must be cold.

MYRCELLA: Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.

JAIME: Prince Trystane. Hows your jaw?

TRYSTANE: A fleabite.

ELLARIA: What are you doing in Dorne?

JAIME: Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.

DORAN: And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.

JAIME: We received a threatening message. The princesss necklace in the jaws of a viper.

Jaime looks at Ellaria.

MYRCELLA (surprised): That necklace was stolen from my room.

Doran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.

JAIME: Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.

DORAN: We cant behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But Ive seen war. Ive seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. Ive seen the orphans starving in the cities. I dont want to lead my people into that hell.

ELLARIA: No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.

DORAN: And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

Everyone drinks. Ellaria dumps her cup out on the floor and looks at Doran.

DORAN: King Tommen insists on his sisters return to the capital?

JAIME: Im afraid he does.

DORAN: I cannot disobey my Kings command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to Kings Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.

JAIME: I accept.

DORAN: One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.

JAIME: You have my word.

ELLARIA: The word of a Kingslayer.

Ellaria gets up and walks to Doran.

ELLARIA: No wonder you cant stand. You have no spine.

Ellaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.

DORAN: You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you wont.

Doran lets go. Ellaria leaves the room.

JAIME: May I inquire into the fate of my man?

DORAN: Tell me, Ser Jaime, in Kings Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?

JAIME: He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished its me.

DORAN: Prince Trystane must learn judgement if hes to rule one day. Ill let him decide.

Jaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.

TRYSTANE: I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.

JAIME: Youre a good man.

TRYSTANE: On one condition.

INT. DORNE - CELL

Bronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the others hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.

NYMERIA: Why do we play? Im better than you, Ill always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I dont think, I cant recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didnt it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.

TYENE: Youre going to miss.

NYMERIA: I never miss.

TYENE: You will. Youre thinking too much. Now youre nervous. What if shes right?

Nymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.

NYMERIA: Luck.

TYENE: Now its my turn.

NYMERIA: Youre too slow. Youve always been too slow.

Nymeria sticks her hands out and blows a kiss to Tyene. Tyene slaps her across the face then blows one back. They get in fighting stances as the guards arrive. They take Bronn out of his cell.

BRONN: Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?

AREO: Youll find out very soon.

Bronn starts leaving the prison.

TYENE: Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?

BRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.

TYENE: And thats the truth!

NYMERIA: Slut.

Tyene laughs.

INT. DORNE - PALACE

Areo escorts Bronn into Dorans room.

JAIME: Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

DORAN: : I didnt realize there were knights of the Blackwater.

BRONN: Only the one.

JAIME: I believe youve already met Prince Trystane.

BRONN: Prince. Sorry about the other day.

JAIME: Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. Hes agreed to grant you your freedom.

BRONN: Im glad to hear it. The pie looks good.

JAIME: There was one condition.

Jaime nods to Areo. Areo elbows Bronn in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.

DORAN: Perhaps some soup instead?

EXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR

Arya pushes her oyster cart through the street.

ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--

Two shady looking men approach her.

MAN: How much for your little clam?

They laugh and walk away. Arya looks down the street and sees the Thin Man, looking over another sailors application.

ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!

Arya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch. She starts pushing the cart again and makes eye contact with the Thin Man.

THIN MAN (waving): Come on.

Arya stares off into the distance.

THIN MAN: Some oysters, girl! Im talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!

Arya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat. A Iron Banker approaches him and Arya starts walking away from the Thin Man and towards them.

BANKER: Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.

MACE: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.

BANKER: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

MACE: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, Ill be sure to send the Arbors finest your way.

BANKER: Im afraid I dont partake.

Arya studies the group, focuses in on Meryn, and begins following them with her cart.

EXT. BRAAVOS - IRON BANK

MACE: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.

BANKER: I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.

MACE: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.

Meryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.

BANKER: Most unfortunate for the glovers.

MACE: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.

BANKER: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

MACE: You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.

Mace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it.

EXT. IRON BANK - LATER

Arya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank, eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank.

BANKER: Im afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.

MACE: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

BANKER: I don't have that gift.

MACE: It's not a gift, its a skill, anyone can learn it. So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown

INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY

Meryn Trant and his men walk through the doorway.

MERYN: I thought that old shit would never stop singing.

MAN: It wasnt bad, though.

MERYN: The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.

They arrive at a door.

MERYN: This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

MAN: Youre buying?

MERYN: Oh, Im buying. But I never was good at sharing.

They enter the brothel. Arya pulls up to the doorway with her cart and sees the men entering.

INT. BROTHEL

Arya walks through the door with a tray of oysters. The brothel keeper stops her.

BROTHEL KEEPER: Sell your fish somewhere else.

PROSTITUTE: Oh let her in, Brusco, Im hungry. Come here, sweetness.

The brothel keeper gestures nods for Arya to go on. She walks to the prostitute and the man shes with.

PROSTITUTE: They say oysters get the juices flowing. Well take half a dozen.

ARYA: Three coppers.

Arya begins cutting an oyster open.

JOHN: Heres a silver because the lady likes you.

The man places a silver on her tray in exchange for the oysters. Arya turns and sees Trants men being taken to a back room.

INT. BROTHEL - BACK ROOM

Arya enters the room and peers through a divider to see a prostitute posing for Meryn.

MERYN: Too old.

HEAD PROSTITUTE: Brea.

Brea poses for Meryn.

MERYN: Too old.

HEAD: I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.

A younger, 20-something prostitute poses for Meryn.

MERYN: Too old.

The people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what hes asking for.

MERYN: Do you have what I want or not?

HEAD: Of course. Of course.

One of Trants men crosses to the other side of the divider and confronts Arya.

MAN: Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.

The man drags her into the room.

MAN: Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.

MAN 2: Ill have one.

Meryn stares at Arya.

HEAD: Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!

The head prostitute brings in a child.

MERYN: Good.

The head prostitute hands Meryn an hourglass. He hands it back.

MERYN: Ill tell you when were done.

He leads the girl towards a bedroom.

MERYN: Youll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.

HEAD: Of course.

The head prostitute realizes Arya is still standing there.

HEAD: Ill have you whipped, girl! Go on!

Arya leaves the room, but takes one last glance at where Meryn is taking the girl.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE

Jaqen kneels next to a man at the fountain of the center of the room and offers him a drink from the fountain.

MAN: Valaar morghulis.

The man takes a drink. Arya approaches Jaqen.

JAQEN: And?

ARYA: The Thin Man wasnt hungry today.

JAQEN: Perhaps thats why the man is thin.

The man drops to the ground, creating a thud off-screen.

ARYA: Tomorrow.

JAQEN: Tomorrow.

JAQEN: A girl has work to do.

Arya walks towards the man who is now collapsed on the ground.

INT. DORNE - PALACE

Doran is addressing Ellaria with Areo standing guard next to the three Sand Snakes.

DORAN: Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.

She kneels and kisses his ring, crying. Nymeria and Obara look disgusted, Tyenes face reveals less.

DORAN: I believe in second chances. I dont believe in third chances.

INT. DORNE - JAIMES ROOM

Jaime is writing a letter in his former cell that is now unlocked. Ellaria enters.

ELLARIA: You write like a 7 year old.

JAIME: Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.

ELLARIA: He didnt try to make you pay?

ELLARIA: Then maybe hes changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know youll be bringing her daughter home

JAIME: She will.

ELLARIA: You love her very much, dont you?

JAIME: Of course, shes my niece.

ELLARIA: I wasnt talking about her.

Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.

ELLARIA: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  Its always changing, who were supposed to love and who were not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.

Ellaria pauses, taking a walks around the room.

ELLARIA: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.

Ellaria exits the room.

INT. SHIREENS TENT

Shireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.

SHIREEN: Father. Arent you cold?

STANNIS: No. What are you reading?

SHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.

STANNIS: Whats it about?

SHIREEN: Its the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.

STANNIS: The dance of dragons? Why is that a dance?

SHIREEN: Thats just what they call it.

STANNIS: Doesnt make much sense.

SHIREEN: I think its poetic.

STANNIS: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?

SHIREEN: I wouldnt have chosen either. Its all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.

STANNIS: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.

SHIREEN: Its alright, father.

STANNIS: You dont even know what Im talking about.

SHIREEN: It doesnt matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?

STANNIS: Yes there is.

SHIREEN: Good, I want to. Im the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and Im your daughter.

They hug.

STANNIS: Forgive me.

EXT. STANNIS CAMP

Shireen is flanked by guards as she walks towards a pyre, clutching the stag Davos gave her. When she arrives at the pyre Melisandre steps to the front.

SHIREEN: Wheres my father? I want to see my father.

MELISANDRE: It will all be over soon, Princess.

The men drag her to the pyre and tie her up.

SHIREEN: Wheres my father? No you cant do this, father where are you?!

Stannis watches on from the crowd.

SHIREEN: Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!

SELYSE: Its what the Lord wants. Its a good thing. A great thing.

MELISANDRE: The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.

SELYSE: If we dont act then well all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice

MELISANDRE: Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!

SHIREEN: Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!

SELYSE: I cant.

STANNIS: Theres no other way. She has Kings blood.

MELISANDRE: Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!

SHIREEN: Mother, dont do this please! Please help! Dont do this! Please, father! Mother, help!

Melisandre lights the pyre. Selyse runs towards the pyre and is stopped by Stannis men. Shireen burns as Melisandre, Selyse, and Stannis look on, Melisandre pleased, Selyse horrified, and Stannis conflicted.

SELYSE: No...

EXT. MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT

Daenerys sits next to Missandei at the top of the pit, with an open seat between her and Tyrion at the end, and Daario standing behind them. Hizdahr takes the open seat.

DAENERYS: Where have you been?

HIZDAHR: Just making sure everythings in order.

Camera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd.

ANNOUNCER (Valyrian): Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!

The Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar. Cut to Daenerys box - she and Missandei look disgusted, Daario looks impressed. Two gladiators enter the pit.

ANNOUNCER: My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?

QUICK: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.

STRONG: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.

They stand waiting in front of her. The crowd is silent.

HIZDAHR: Theyre waiting for you. Clap your hands.

Daenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment, and with a look of disgust on her face, she claps her hands. The crowd roars and they start fighting. After some parries, the Quick man slices at the Strong mans neck.

DAARIO: That one, the smaller man, no question, thats where you should put your money.

TYRION: The smaller man it is.

DAENERYS: Im not putting my money anywhere.

HIZDAHR: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.

DAARIO: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.

HIZDAHR: I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.

DAENERYS: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?

Hizdahr is silent.

DAARIO: Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldnt get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahrs neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles werent. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.

The Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke. Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily. Tyrion says nothing.

HIZDAHR: You dont approve?

TYRION: Theres always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.

HIZDAHR: Fair enough, yet -- its an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

TYRION: Its easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.

HIZDAHR: Im not talking about myself. Im talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.

Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind.

DAENERYS: That is greatness?

HIZDAHR: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

TYRION: My father would have liked you.

ANNOUNCER: We ask again: who will triumph?

DAENERYS: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

HIZDAHR: At your command?

DAENERYS: If need be.

ANNOUNCER: A Meereenese champion?

The crowd applauds.

HIZDAHR: How many people will die to make this happen?

DAENERYS: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.

HIZDAHR (looks at pit): Those men think theyre dying for a good reason.

DAENERYS: Someone elses reason.

HIZDAHR: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They dont know their own minds, but you do.

TYRION: Well said, youre an eloquent man. Doesnt mean youre wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.

ANNOUNCER: ...or a Westerosi Knight?!

Crowd jeers.

JORAH (O.S.): I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.

Daenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion.

HIZDAHR: Your Grace--

DAARIO: Shut your mouth.

Daenerys claps. Jorah nods. They begin fighting, with Daenerys eyes following Jorah. He takes a blow to the mouth, is knocked down and starts bleeding. He gets up, has his sword knocked away, and pulls out a dagger. He wrestles with the man trying to choke him, throws him off, then stabs him in the chest. He pulls the dagger out, looking at Daenerys, throws it away, and picks up his longsword.

Jorah squares off against a flashy fighter that just brutally stabbed another fighter through the back. He slices Jorah in the cheek. The other two fighters square off, with a heavily armored fighter wielding a spear killing his opponent. The crowd cheers.

Jorahs opponent slices Jorahs arm then knocks him over, knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorahs throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys.

TYRION: You can end this.

HIZDAHR: She cannot.

TYRION: You can!

The fighter holds his blade to Jorahs throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorahs opponent in the back, killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman, is knocked over, but catches the spear before it reaches his throat. He gets back up and the two face off again. Jorah spins, somersaults, and stabs him through the stomach, killing him. He looks up to Daenerys.

Jorah reaches for his opponents spear. He picks it up and hurls it towards Daenerys seat. Daario rushes to protect Daenerys and everyone else gets out of the way. It connects with a Son of the Harpy.

Cut to the crowd. Many audience members have put on Sons of the Harpy masks.

DAARIO: Protect your queen!

The Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd. Unsullied guards and Daario surround Daenerys and Missandei, fighting off the Harpys. Hizdahr starts running towards Daenerys.

HIZDAHR: Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--

Two Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death. They run at Daenerys. Daario takes one out, and Jorah comes up from the pit to take Hizdahrs spot and take out the other. He offers his hand to Daenerys and she takes it. He leads her down to the pit with Daario and the Unsullied, leaving Tyrion and Missandei.

A Harpy comes towards Missandei. Tyrion comes from behind, pulls him to his knees, and slits his throat. He leads her down to the pit.

TYRION: Stay close!

Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys, Daario, and Jorah head towards a side exit.

JORAH: This way!

They run through the exit, but a door swings shut. A Son of the Harpy steps out and Jorah kills him.

DAARIO: The other side, follow me!

They rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei.

DAARIO: Protect your queen!

Jorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit. Sons of the Harpy begin to rush from the other exit they were heading towards. They surround the ring, testing out the outer ring before they begin rushing. A few make it past the outer ring but are killed by Daario. Missandei and Daenerys join hands and Daenerys closes her eyes.

A roar is heard in the distance. All of the Harpys look up. Drogon appears, breathing fire and circling the pit. The Sons run away from Daenerys to the edge of the pit. One charges at her and Drogon rips him apart. He breathes fire on 4-5 of them at a time before a spear hits his back. 2 more spears connect and he starts slowing down.

DAENERYS: Drogon!

She takes a spear from his neck. He roars at her, but then closes his mouth. She slowly reaches to touch his nose. More spears are thrown at him by Sons of the Harpy and he turns to them and roars. Daario continues to fight off every Harpy that comes near her.

Daenerys climbs onto Drogons back slowly.

DAENERYS: Valahd..

Drogon runs towards the Harpys, starts flapping and then takes off from the Pit. He flies past the Pyramid and into the sky as Tyrion, Jorah, Daario, and Missandei stare up at him.

A dragon roars in the distance.

END EPISODE

INT. STANNISS CAMP - STANNISS TENT

Stannis straps his armor on.

MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.

STANNIS: We ride for Winterfell.

MELISANDRE: And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.

INT. STANNISS CAMP

Stannis walks by his men as they prepare for battle. One soldier approaches him.

SOLDIER: Your Grace.

STANNIS: Prepare to form up.

SOLDIER: Your Grace.

The soldier waits for a response from Stannis.

STANNIS: Tell me.

SOLDIER: The men. Many deserted before dawn.

STANNIS: How many?

SOLDIER: Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.

Stannis is speechless. He looks to Melisandre who appears even more devastated than he. Another soldier comes up to Stannis.

SOLDIER 2: Your Grace?

STANNIS: Speak up. It cant be worse than mutiny.

The man is silent.

EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE STANNISS CAMP

Stannis is led by his men to a tree. Stannis looks up and sees Selyse hanging from it. Stannis takes a long look but tries not to reveal his emotions.

The men cut the noose and bring her to the ground.

SOLDIER: Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

Stannis seethes but says nothing.

STANNIS: Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.

Stannis walks from the woods back to camp.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY

JON: He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.

SAM: So what are you gonna do?

JON: Im gonna hope they dont learn how to climb the wall.

SAM: But the Dragonglass?

JON (shakes his head): No ones ever getting that back, now. It wouldnt have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.

SAM (confused): But you killed a White Walker.

JON: With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw

SAM: Hes made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

JON: Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. Hows it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)

SAM: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasnt winning any elections back then.

JON: Heres to us then. Long may they sneer.

Jon and Sam clink glasses and drink. Sam looks to Jon.

JON: What?

SAM: I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. Thats what Im meant to be, not this.

JON: I need you here, Sam. If you leave, whos left to give me advice I trust?

SAM: Well, theres Edd.

Jon gives Sam a look.

SAM: Ill be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemons gone. The Citadel has the worlds greatest library. Ill learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.

Jon stares at Sam, saying nothing.

SAM: If Gilly stays here then shell die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And Ill end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that Ill see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) Id rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.

Jon inhales, exhales, then nods somberly. Sam smiles.

SAM: Thank you.

JON: You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

SAM: Theyll bloody try.

Jon looks at Sam incredulously.

JON: Sam?

SAM: What?

JON: Sam

Sam smiles.

JON: Youve just been beaten half to death. How did you--

SAM (smiling): Very carefully.

Jon smiles and lets out a small laugh.

JON: Im glad the end of the worlds working out for someone.

They sit in silence for a moment.

SAM: Ill come back.

JON (raises a glass): To your return.

SAM: To my return.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK

Sam, Gilly, and little Sam mount the horses. Sam looks up to see Jon watching from the top of his steps.They exchange a wave, and then Sam begins riding out of Castle Black.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL

Stanniss depleted army marches onto Winterfell. Stannis is at the front with flaming heart banners flying all around him.

EXT. WINTERFELL -  COURTYARD

The Bolton army is preparing for battle.

INT. WINTERFELL - SANSAS ROOM

Sansa uses the device she previously picked up to unlock her door. She drops the device and then exits her tower with a hood on.

EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Sansa walks by the Bolton men as they are preparing for battle.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL - HILL

Podrick returns to he and Briennes camp with firewood and dead rabbits. He hears screaming then looks down to see Stanniss army marching for Winterfell. He drops the wood and rabbits and sprints back to Brienne.

Brienne is staring at the Broken Tower.

PODRICK: My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

BRIENNE: How do you know its Stannis?

PODRICK: Hes carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. Ill never forget it.

Brienne takes one last look at the Broken Tower. She sees there is still no candle in the window.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER

Sansa approaches the Tower with a candle in hand.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL - HILL

Brienne takes one last, hard look at the Tower, then turns around and heads for Stanniss army. Podrick grabs his axe and follows her. Right as they turn away, a candle appears at the top of the Broken Tower.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL

STANNIS: Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.

SOLDIER: Theres not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

Stannis looks to the distance and sees the Bolton army racing towards him as they come over the top of a hill.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER

Sansa looks down at the ensuing battle from the top of the Broken Tower with a candle in the window.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL

Stannis sees he the army approaching. He takes a deep breath then unsheathes his sword. Cut to an overhead shot revealing Stannis is badly outnumbered.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER

Sansa watches from the window as the fight begins. She walks away from the window.

EXT. WINTERFELL - WOODS

Pan across the ground to reveal all but one of Stanniss men are slaughtered alongside various banners and shields with his sigil. Stannis hobbles away from these men, using his sword as a crutch. Two Bolton men arrive on horse and kill the lone survivor of Stanniss men. They charge at Stannis, one slices his leg, but he kills them both with a dagger and sword then falls to the ground.

Stannis leans onto a tree and groans. He looks down to his bleeding leg with a resigned look, then looks up to the sound of a horse riding.

STANNIS: Bolton has women fighting for him.

Cut up to Brienne of Tarth.

BRIENNE: I do not fight for the Boltons. Im Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?

Stannis is silent for a long moment.

STANNIS: I did.

Brienne approaches him and unsheathes her sword.

BRIENNE: In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?

STANNIS: Go on, do your duty.

Brienne unsheathes her sword, pulls it back, swings forward, and--

CUT TO: EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD

Ramsay plunges his sword into a survivor. Then he surveys the corpses on the battlefield.

RAMSAY: Looks like were done here.

Ramsay heads back towards his horse but sees one of Stanniss men is survive, and is attempting to crawl away.

SURVIVOR: I surrender. I surrender!

RAMSAY: And I accept your surrender.

Ramsay plunges his sword into the man then pulls it out and wipes the blood off.

RAMSAY (to squire): Lets head back. My wife must be lonely.

Pan out to reveal the bodies on the battlefield.

EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Sansa hurries through Winterfell with her hood on. She heads up the stairs, sees one of the Bolton men walking her way, and doubles back.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BALCONY

Sansa rushes through a door towards the exit. She finds Myranda and Theon waiting for her, with Myrandas bow drawn.

MYRANDA: My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.

THEON: Go with her. Please.

SANSA: I know what Ramsay is. I know what hell do to me. (looks to Theon) If Im going to die, let it happen while theres some of me left.

MYRANDA: Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You cant die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesnt need all of you. Just the parts hell use to make his heir. Until youve given him a boy or two and hes finished using them. (raises bow) Hes got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?

Sansa says nothing.

MYRANDA: Youre leaving it to me? Good. Lets begin.

She draws her arrow back. Just as she goes to release it, Theon tackles her into a wall, causing the arrow to miss Sansa. They struggle for a moment.

MYRANDA: Stop! Stop!

Theon throws her over the edge, killing her on impact. As Sansa and Theon go to the edge to inspect the body, a horn begins to blare.

MAN: Open the gates!

Bolton men return from the battle and ride through the gates to Winterfell.

THEON: Hes coming back.

Theon grabs Sansas hand and leads her along the walls. They climb to the top of the wall and look down to see a pile of snow at the bottom. Theon offers his hand to Sansa, she takes it, and they leap off of the wall.

INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL

Meryn Trant looks to 3 young girls in front of him and tightens his grip on the stick in his hand. He walks behind the first one and whips her, she starts crying. He does the same to the second and she cries as well. He walks up to the third girl, whose face is hidden by her hair, and whips her in the back. She doesnt react. He whips her harder in the side and doesnt get a reaction. He whips her a third time across the face and the girl still doesnt make a sound.

MERYN: I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.

The two other girls flee the room. The third removes her hair to show an unknown face. Meryn punches her in the stomach. She falls to the ground doubled over. Meryn smiles but loses the smile when he sees she is reaching for something. The girl pulls off her face, revealing she is Arya, and leaps towards Trant, stabbing him in the eye. She stabs his other eye then gags him with his shirt as he screams. He grabs at her but she stabs him in the chest until he rolls on his side.

ARYA: You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. Ive gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. Im glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?

Trant struggles to make a noise through the gag.

ARYA: I cant hear you.

She stabs him in the stomach.

ARYA: You know who I am. Im Arya Stark.

A look of surprise comes across Trants face, he grunts, and then Arya stabs him in the back. She removes the gag.

ARYA: Do you know who you are?

Trant whimpers.

ARYA: Youre no one. Youre nothing.

She slowly slits his throat and he keels over.

INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - FACE ROOM

Arya walks into the room holding the face of the girl she wore to the brothel. She returns it to where she took it from.

JAQEN: A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.

WAIF: I was right about her.

JAQEN: You were.

WAIF: Youre not ready. Not at all.

The waif grabs Arya and holds her in front of Jaqen.

JAQEN: That mans life wasnt yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.

Jaqen holds up the same vial he gave to Arya to give to the Thin Man. The waif holds Aryas face up near the vial as she struggles.

JAQEN: Only death can pay for life.

Jaqen drinks the vial and then falls straight to the ground.

ARYA: No! No! No, you dont die! Dont die! (sobs)

WAIF: Why are you crying?

ARYA: He was my friend.

WAIF: No he wasnt. Didnt you listen to him?

JAQEN (O.S.): He was no one.

Arya turns to see a man looking identical to Jaqen standing behind her.

ARYA: But if youre (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Whos this?

JAQEN: No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.

Arya reaches and pulls off the Jaqen face, revealing the face of an old man.

JAQEN: The faces are for no one.

Arya pulls off the old man face to reveal a younger mans face.

JAQEN: You are still someone.

Arya pulls off the young mans face to reveal a different old man.

JAQEN: And to someone

Arya pulls off multiple faces, revealing the face of multiple different men.

JAQEN: ...the faces are as good as poison.

Arya pulls off the final face and sees her own face staring back at her.

ARYA: I cant see!

Aryas vision begins to blur until the screen goes black.

ARYA: Whats happening?! Whats happening?!

EXT. DORNE - DOCK

Myrcella kisses Prince Doran.

DORAN (to Jaime): I wish you a safe journey home.

JAIME: Thank you.

Doran looks to Ellaria and nods. She walks up to Myrcella.

ELLARIA: Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.

Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips, holding the kiss then rubbing her lips. She nods to Jaime and Jaime nods back. Jaime helps Myrcella into the boat.

BRONN: Maybe Ill come visit you sometime.

TYENE: Maybe Ill come visit you.

BRONN: Dont wait too long. Ive a noble woman to marry back home.

TYENE (leans in): You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear)

JAIME (to Bronn): Whenever youre ready, My Lord.

Bronn nods to Tyene and the Snakes, then heads to the boat.

INT. SEA OF DORNE - BOAT

Myrcella looks down at her lion necklace.

JAIME: Try not to lose it this time.

MYRCELLA: Ill never take it off again.

JAIME: I know you didnt want to leave Dorne. But Im glad youre coming home. Your mothers desperate to see you. And Im glad Trystanes coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. Youre lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so so well arranged.

MYRCELLA: Do you think mother will like him.

JAIME: If she sees youre happy, Im sure she will.

MYRCELLA (laughing): And you really believe that?

JAIME (smiles): Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?

MYRCELLA: She likes you.

JAIME: Im not so sure about that. Listen. Theres something Ive wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that youve seen more of the world, youve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but youve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is we dont choose whom we love. We just Its beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.

MYRCELLA: No you dont.

JAIME: What Im trying to say. What Im trying and failing to say

MYRCELLA: I know what youre trying to say.

JAIME: No. Im afraid you dont.

Myrcella stands up and looks Jaime in the eyes.

MYRCELLA: I do.

She takes his good hand in hers.

MYRCELLA: I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And Im glad. Im glad that youre my father.

Jaime looks shocked but happy. They embrace. She releases the hug and smiles at Jaime, with blood beginning to trickle out her nose.

JAIME: Myrcella?

The bleeding gets worse.

JAIME: Myrcella?!

Myrcella collapses in Jaimes arms, blood streaming down her face.

JAIME: Myrcella?! Myrcella?!

CUT TO: EXT. DORNE - DOCK

Ellaria stares at Jaimes ship from the dock. Blood begins to trickle out of her nose and splatter the floor. Tyene hands her a rag for the blood and she wipes it away then thrrows the rag away. She opens the antidote and drinks it down. She and the Sand Snakes begin walking from the dock.

INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID

Tyrion, Daario, and Jorah sit on the steps in Danys throne room.

TYRION (to Jorah): You love her, dont you? How could you not. Of course, its hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.

DAARIO: Does he always talk so much?

Jorah nods. Missandei brings Grey Worm into the room, with bandages around his torso.

GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal.

JORAH: Torgo Nudho.

GREY WORM: You should not be here.

DAARIO: No, but he is.

GREY WORM: Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

DAARIO: Our queen would be dead if not for him.

MISSANDEI (Valyrian): Its true. And I would be dead if not for the (look at Tyrion) little man.

TYRION (Valyrian): Dwarf. I believe thats the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit nostril.

MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) A bit rusty.

TYRION: (Valyrian) Rusty (Common Tongue) Thank you.

GREY WORM: I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.

DAARIO: You missed a good scrap.

JORAH: None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

TYRION: Hes right. The dragon headed north. If were going to find her, thats where were to go.

JORAH: We? Youre a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.

TYRION: And I intend to help her do it.

JORAH: Youve been here for how many days now? Ive fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.

TYRION: You betrayed her!

JORAH: Careful now.

TYRION: And she exiled you, twice, I believe?

JORAH: The second time thanks to you.

TYRION: Dont blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

DAARIO: (gestures to Tyrion) Hes right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And hes right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way well know is if we ask her.

TYRION: Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

JORAH: If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.

DAARIO (to Tyrion): Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

TYRION: Pardon me?

DAARIO: Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

TYRION: Not precisely, but I have other skills thatd be very useful--

DAARIO: Can you fight?

TYRION: I have fought. I dont claim to be a great warrior.

DAARIO: Are you good on a horse?

TYRION: Middling.

DAARIO: So mainly you talk?

TYRION: And drink. Ive survived so far.

DAARIO: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.

JORAH: Hes a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

DAARIO: They wouldnt. They will listen to Grey Worm.

GREY WORM: Ill come with you. Ill find our queen.

MISSANDEI: You are not strong enough to go anywhere.

GREY WORM: I am.

DAARIO: He is, hes the toughest man with no balls Ive ever met. But you still cant go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.

MISSANDEI: Its true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.

DAARIO: And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queens closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like its you and me, Jorah the Andal. Lets find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.

Tyrion walks down the steps towards Missandei and Grey Worm. They exchange uncertain glances with each other.

EXT. MEEREEN - BALCONY

Tyrion stands in the place where Dany had Mossador executed and watches Jorah and Daario ride out of the city.

VOICE (O.S.): Hello, old friend.

Tyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him.

VARYS: I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.

TYRION: I suppose theres no point in asking how you found me.

VARYS: The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me youve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.

TYRION: Well, she didnt execute me, so thats a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and Im stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?

VARYS: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

TYRION: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

VARYS: If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

Tyrion looks up to Varys with a slight smile.

TYRION: I did miss you.

VARYS: Oh, I know.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU

Dany looks to Drogon who is lying down in a ring full of bones.

DAENERYS: We have to go home.

Drogon lies down and grunts.

DAENERYS: My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?

Daenerys pets his nose but gets no response.

DAENERYS: How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)

Drogon begins turning away from her to lick at his wounds.

DAENERYS: Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.

She climbs back on his back, but he hisses and bucks her off, then goes to sleep.

DAENERYS: Well, theres no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.

Dany begins walking across the plateau to explore. A horse gallops in the distance. Camera cuts to reveal the pony-tail of a Dothraki. Three more Dothraki men arrive on horseback. Daenerys drops her ring to the ground. Another group of Dothraki arrives, and then the rest of the khalasar. They begin circling around Daenerys, howling.

INT. CERSEIS CELL

Cersei is huddled in the corner. She shudders as the door opens.

SEPTA: Confess. Confess.

Cersei looks up to the Septa.

INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROWS ROOM

Cersei is knelt before the High Sparrow in the room where she was taken away.

CERSEI: I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--

HIGH SPARROW: You wish to make a confession?

CERSEI: Once Ive confessed, will I be free?

SPARROW: Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

CERSEI: The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.

SPARROW: Name him.

CERSEI: Lancel Lannister.

SPARROW: Your cousin. And the Kings squire.

CERSEI: I was lonely and afraid.

SPARROW: You had a husband.

CERSEI: A husband of whoring every chance he got.

SPARROW: His sins do not pardon your own.

CERSEI: May the gods forgive me.

SPARROW: Other men?

CERSEI: No.

SPARROW: No others?

CERSEI: No.

SPARROW: Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?

CERSEI: I do.

SPARROW: There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

CERSEI: A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brothers children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.

SPARROW: Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.

CERSEI: Trial? I have confessed?

SPARROW: To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

CERSEI: I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mothers mercy. I havent seen my son I dont know how long its been. I need to see him. Please.

SPARROW: You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

CERSEI: Thank you. Thank you.

SPARROW: The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.

CERSEI: I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.

SPARROW: Good.

CERSEI: Am I free to go?

SPARROW: After your atonement.

CERSEI: My atonement?

INT. CERSEIS CELL

Cersei is stripped naked and has the dirt washed off of her by the septas. After they scrub her clean, they sit her down and begin chopping her hair away with a knife. They leave her naked, with short hair and a bloody scalp, and then shut the door on her.

EXT. KINGS LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

Cersei is carried to the top of the steps, in front of a massive crowd of Kings Landing citizens.

SPARROW: A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.

The septas remove her robe. She stands naked before the citizens of Kings Landing, who gasp. They force her to start walking down the stairs.

SEPTA: Shame. Shame. Shame. (rings bell)

The septa repeats Shame. Shame. Shame. and rings the bell through the duration of Cerseis walk. Cersei is escorted by the Sparrows through the crowd of people. Silence at first, but once one man yells Cunt!, she begins to be heckled.

CROWD: Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!

They begin pelting her with food. A prostitute runs in front of Cersei with her breasts out.

WOMAN: Ive had half as many cocks as the queen!

The sparrows force her out of Cerseis way. A man with his penis out runs in front of her later in the walk.

MAN: Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!

As Cersei approaches the end of her walk things get more violent. A man spits directly in her face, and a Sparrow has to beat a woman with a club as she charges Cersei. She is knocked to her knees at the end of her walk, but gets back to her feet when she sees the Red Keep in the distance. She finally reaches the end of the walk of atonement, and enters the Red Keep, sobbing.

INT. RED KEEP

Kevan Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, and the Lannister guards wait for her. Qyburn rushes to cover her naked body with a blanket as Cersei begins weeping.

QYBURN: Your Grace. Its good to have you back. Come. Well take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.

Cut to her bloody feet. We hear two giant footsteps off screen.

QYBURN: May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.

A hulking man, who is revealed to have a blue face through the eye holes in his helm, walks over to Qyburn and Cersei. He takes Cersei in his arms.

QYBURN: If it please Your Grace, hes taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Graces enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK

Jon and Davos exit the elevator.

DAVOS: He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!

JON: We dont have enough men to make any difference.

DAVOS: The wildlings will make a difference!

JON: The wildlings wont ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--

DAVOS: You saved their bloody lives. If theyre going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.

JON: Its not their fight!

The gates to Castle Black are opened and Melisandre arrives, alone and on horseback. Jon and Davos rush over to her.

JON: Stannis?

No response.

DAVOS: Shireen? The princess?

A long look but no response. Melisandre walks away from the two of them.

INT. CASTLE BLACK - JONS ROOM

Jon goes through the various scrolls on his desk. Olly enters the room.

OLLY: Lord Commander. Its one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says hes still alive.

JON (stands up): Are you sure hes talking about Benjen?

OLLY: Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.

Jon rushes out of his room down to the ground. He is met by Alliser.

ALLISER: Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.

JON: He could be lying.

ALLISER: Could be. There are ways to find out.

JON: Where is he?

ALLISER: Over there.

Jon walks past a group of Brothers holding torches. He sees a sign that reads TRAITOR when he passes them, and turns to see he is cornered. Alliser stabs him in the gut.

ALLISER: For the Watch.

Another Brother stabs him.

BROTHER: For the Watch.

A third Brother stabs him.

BROTHER: For the Watch.

A fourth brother stabs him.

BROTHER: For the Watch.

A fifth brother stabs him.

BROTHER: For the Watch.

Jon falls to his knees, struggling but still alive. Olly walks up to Jon.

JON: Olly

Olly stabs him.

OLLY: For the Watch.

Jon stays on his knees, then falls backwards. The Brothers walk away from him. Jon lays on the ground, expressionless. A puddle of blood spreads to the top of the screen.

END EPISODE

END SEASON

Pan down from the inside of The Wall towards Castle Black. GHOST is howling. Slow zoom to JON SNOWs body, lying in the snow. A sign with the word TRAITOR is posted on a beam behind him. Closeup on JON SNOW. He is staring upwards, lifelessly. GHOST howls louder and pushes against the door to his pen.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS CHAMBER

DAVOS hears GHOSTs howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOWs body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOWs body. Other brothers of the Nights Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOWs body.

NIGHTS WATCHMAN: Its the Lord Commander!

DOLOROUS EDD and other Nights Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.

DAVOS: Help me get him inside.

The other Nights Watch brothers pick up JON SNOWs body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM

DOLOROUS EDD wipes the table clean. The other Nights Watch brothers place JON SNOWs body on the table. DOLOROUS EDD places his hand on JON SNOWs wounds, then brushes JON SNOWs eyes closed.

DOLOROUS EDD: Thorne did this.

DAVOS: How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?

DOLOROUS EDD: Trust? The men in this room.

DAVOS: Does the wolf know you?

DOLOROUS EDD looks at DAVOS over his shoulder and nods.

DAVOS: We need all the help we can get.

As DOLOROUS EDD moves towards the door, someone knocks on it. The Nights Watch brothers draw their blades.

MELISANDRE (O.S.): Ser Davos.

DOLOROUS EDD looks over his shoulder at DAVOS. DAVOS nods. The Nights Watch brothers sheathe their swords. DOLOROUS EDD walks to the door and opens it. MELISANDRE enters. DOLOROUS EDD closes the door behind her. MELISANDRE is distressed at the sight of JON SNOWs body.

MELISANDRE: I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.

DAVOS: I cant speak for the flames, but hes gone.

MELISANDRE touches JON SNOWs cheek.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL

ALLISER THORNE sits at the high table among the other leaders of the Nights Watch. The rest of the Nights Watch brothers are shouting at each other.

MALE VOICE #1: He was our Lord Commander!

MALE VOICE #2: He never should have been!

ALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets.

ALLISER THORNE: You all know why youre here. Jon Snow is dead.

NIGHTS WATCHMAN #1: Who killed him?

ALLISER THORNE: I did.

The Nights Watch brothers resume shouting.

ALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.

NIGHTS WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!

NIGHTS WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!

The shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.

ALLISER THORNE: Youre right!

The shouting stops.

ALLISER THORNE: Weve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Nights Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Nights Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Nights Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, Ive no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.

The men begin to murmur among themselves.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM

GHOST nudges JON SNOWs hand and whimpers.

DAVOS: Hell have seen we didnt come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.

DOLOROUS EDD: I dont care whos sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor.

DAVOS: We dont have the numbers.

DOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.

DAVOS: Its not enough. I didnt know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldnt have wanted his friends to die for nothing.

DOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.

DAVOS: We need to fight, but we dont need to die. Not if we have help.

NIGHTS WATCHMAN: Whos gonna help us?

DAVOS: Youre not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

DOLOROUS EDDs washes over with realization. He turns to the Nights Watchman at his side.

DOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Dont let anyone in. Ill be back as soon as I can.

DOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.
INT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE

THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in the roots of the great weirwood. His eyes are pure white. BRAN is lying below the tangle, gripping a single root. His eyes are also pure white.

CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL

YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN are sparring with wooden swords in the commons. BRAN and THREE-EYED RAVEN are standing on a balcony above the courtyard, watching. YOUNG NED knocks YOUNG BENJEN to the ground.

YOUNG RODRIK: Give him another go, Ned.

YOUNG NED helps YOUNG BENJEN to his feet.

BRAN (to THREE-EYED RAVEN): Thats my father. And my Uncle Benjen.

YOUNG NED (to YOUNG BENJEN): Keep your shield up or Ill ring your head like a bell.

YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN begin sparring again. BRAN looks around the commons at the citizens of Winterfell going about their business.

BRAN: They were all so happy.

THREE-EYED RAVEN: So were you once.

YOUNG LYANNA rides into the courtyard on a horse. She circles around YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN.

YOUNG NED: Stop showing off.

YOUNG BENJEN: Lyanna!

BRAN: My Aunt Lyanna. Ive seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.

Closeup on THREE-EYED RAVEN. He turns to look at BRAN, but BRAN has already walked away. BRAN walks closer to the group. YOUNG LYANNA is being helped off her horse by YOUNG HODOR.

YOUNG BENJEN: Would you get out of here? Were sparring.

YOUNG LYANNA: Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

YOUNG BENJEN: I dont know.

YOUNG LYANNA turns and looks at YOUNG HODOR.

YOUNG LYANNA: What about him?

YOUNG NED: Wylis, come here.

BRAN turns to look at YOUNG HODOR. THREE-EYED RAVEN reaches BRANs side.

BRAN: Hodor?

YOUNG LYANNA walks over to YOUNG HODOR with a wooden sword and shield.

YOUNG BENJEN: But hes got giants blood.

YOUNG NED: And youve got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.

YOUNG LYANNA: Benjen always lifts his chin when hes about to charge.

YOUNG HODOR takes the sword and shield.

YOUNG HODOR: And lowers it when hes going to dodge, my lady.

BRAN: Hodor talks?

YOUNG HODOR walks over to YOUNG BENJEN. They both ready to commence sparring, but stop when NAN appears.

NAN: You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. Its no place for you.

NAN takes YOUNG HODOR by the ear and leads him away.

YOUNG NED: Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, hed be unstoppable.

NAN: Well, hes never going to learn to fight because hes a stable boy. So leave him be.

THREE-EYED RAVEN (to BRAN): It is time to go.

BRAN: Please, a little longer.

THREE-EYED RAVEN touches BRAN on the shoulder.

CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE

BRAN is released from the vision. He gasps, then lets go of the root. The white fades from his eyes. A CHILD OF THE FOREST is sitting nearby, staring at him. He props himself up on his wrists and looks at THREE-EYED RAVEN.

BRAN: You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.

THREE-EYED RAVEN: It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, youll drown.

BRAN: I wasnt drowning. I was home.

CHILD OF THE FOREST and THREE-EYED RAVEN exchange a glance. BRAN turns to HODOR, who is sitting with his back against a wall.

BRAN: Wylis.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: Wheres Meera?

HODOR: Hodor.

HODOR carries BRAN outside and sets him down in the snow. MEERA is sitting in the snow at the base of the great weirwood, staring out at the tundra.

BRAN: You shouldnt be here. Its not safe outside the cave.

MEERA: Its not safe anywhere.

BRAN: I saw that Hodor wasnt always Hodor.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: His real name is Wylis. And he could talk and fight and -- and then --

MEERA turns and looks at BRAN.

BRAN: Whats wrong?

MEERA casts her eyes down and looks away.

BRAN: The Three-Eyed Raven says theres a war coming.

MEERA: And were going to fight it in there.

MEERA scoffs and turns away. HODOR picks BRAN up and carries him back inside. A side view of MEERA reveals the same CHILD OF THE FOREST who was watching BRAN, sitting among some stones and frozen shrubbery..

CHILD OF THE FOREST: Brandon Stark needs you.

MEERA: For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.

CHILD OF THE FOREST: He isnt going to stay there forever. And out there he needs you.
DAVOS is staring at JON SNOW. JON SNOW slowly sits up on the table, breathing heavily. He turns his head to look at DAVOS. GHOST is standing in front of JON SNOW, also staring at him. JON SNOW looks down at his body and sees his stab wounds. He begins gasping and shaking. DAVOS takes off his cloak and rushes over to JON SNOW. JON SNOW attempts to stand but falters. DAVOS catches JON SNOW and wraps him in his cloak.

DAVOS: Easy, easy. Easy.

DAVOS ushers JON SNOW back into a sitting position. MELISANDRE enters and stares at JON SNOW.

DAVOS: What do you remember?

JON SNOW: They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldnt be here.

DAVOS: The lady brought you back.

MELISANDRE approaches JON SNOW and kneels in front of him.

MELISANDRE: Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?

JON SNOW: Nothing. There was nothing at all.

MELISANDRE: The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.

DAVOS (to MELISANDRE): Could you give us a moment?

MELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her, grabs a stool, and sits down in front of JON SNOW.

DAVOS: You were dead. And now youre not. Thats completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.

JON SNOW: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now Im back. Why?

DAVOS: I dont know. Maybe well never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.

JON SNOW: I dont know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.

DAVOS: Good. Now go fail again.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD

DOLOROUS EDD, TORMUND, the faithful Nights Watch members, and the Wildlings are all gathered in the courtyard, staring up at the entrance to the room JON SNOW was in. JON SNOW emerges on the balcony, supported by DAVOS. He stares out at the crowd, then walks down the steps with the help of DAVOS and begins walking through the crowd. The men on either side part to let him pass. TORMUND walks up the middle to confront JON SNOW.

TORMUND: They think youre some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.

JON SNOW: Im not a god.

TORMUND: I know that.

TORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.

TORMUND: I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?

JON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces, then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace, and JON SNOW winces again.

DOLOROUS EDD: Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?

JON SNOW: I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.

DOLOROUS EDD laughs.

DOLOROUS EDD: Thats funny. You sure thats still you in there?

Both men laugh.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOWS ROOM

Longclaw is lying on a table. DOLOROUS EDD lifts and admires it, then turns to JON SNOW who is putting some items in a bag.

DOLOROUS EDD: Where you gonna go?

JON SNOW: South.

DOLOROUS EDD: What are you gonna do?

JON SNOW: Get warm.

JON SNOW smiles. DOLOROUS EDD places Longclaw on the table.

DOLOROUS EDD: I was with you at Hardhome. We saw whats out there. We know its coming here. How can you leave us now?

JON SNOW: I did everything I could. You know that.

DOLOROUS EDD: You swore a vow.

JON SNOW: Aye, I pledged my life to the Nights Watch. I gave my life.

DOLOROUS EDD: For all nights to come.

JON SNOW: They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?

A single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway.

MAN (O.S.): Riders approaching!

MAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD

The southern gates open. SANSA, BRIENNE, and PODRICK enter the courtyard on horseback. The Nights Watch and the Wildlings all watfch them. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. The trio dismount from their horses. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD emerge onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard. SANSA slowly spins around until she and JON SNOW lock eyes. JON SNOW descends from the balcony and walks to SANSA. They stare at each other and then embrace.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOWS ROOM

JON SNOW and SANSA are sitting by the fire. SANSA lifts a bowl to her lips and drinks from it.

SANSA: This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?

JON SNOW: With the peas and onions?

SANSA: Mmm.

JON SNOW: We never should have left Winterfell.

SANSA: Dont you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, Dont go, you idiot.

JON SNOW: How could we know?

SANSA: I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.

JON SNOW: We were children.

SANSA: I was awful, just admit it.

JON SNOW chuckles.

JON SNOW: You were occasionally awful. Im sure I cant have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.

SANSA: Can you forgive me?

JON SNOW: Theres nothing to forgive.

SANSA: Forgive me.

JON SNOW: All right. All right, I forgive you.

SANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOWs horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs.

JON SNOW: Youd think after thousands of years, the Nights Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.

SANSA: Where will you go?

JON SNOW: Where will we go? If I dont watch over you, Fathers ghost will come back and murder me.

SANSA: Where will we go?

JON SNOW: I cant stay here, not after what happened.

SANSA: Theres only one place we can go. Home.

JON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?

SANSA: Well take it back from them.

JON SNOW: I dont have an army.

SANSA: How many wildlings did you save?

JON SNOW: They didnt come here to serve me.

SANSA: They owe you their lives.

SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.

SANSA: You think theyll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

JON SNOW: Sansa.

SANSA: Winterfell is our home. Its ours and Aryas and Brans and Rickons. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.

JON SNOW: Im tired of fighting.

JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.

JON SNOW: Its all Ive done since I left home. Ive killed brothers of the Nights Watch. Ive killed wildlings. Ive killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.

SANSA: If we dont take back the North, well never be safe. I want you to help me. But Ill do it myself if I have to.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY

MELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.

DAVOS: My lady.

MELISANDRE: Ser Davos.

DAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?

MELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands.

DAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?

MELISANDRE: Hes the prince that was promised.

DAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.

MELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her.

DAVOS: What happened down there?

MELISANDRE: There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.

MELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her.

DAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?

BRIENNE approaches.

BRIENNE:  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis forces defeated in the field.

DAVOS: My lady, Im Ser Davos Seaworth.

BRIENNE: Weve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.

BRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.

DAVOS: Thats in the past now.

BRIENNE: Yes, its in the past. It doesnt mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know.

DAVOS: Who did?

BRIENNE: Stannis. Just before I executed him.

BRIENNE walks away. MELISANDRE walks in the opposite direction. DAVOS stares at BRIENNE.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - SANSAS ROOM

SANSA is knitting. There is a knock at the door.

SANSA: Yes?

A man of the Nights Watch enters.

MAN: For you, my lady.

The man hands SANSA a scroll. It bears the mockingbird sigil of House Baelish. SANSA unrolls the scroll and reads it.

SANSA: How far is Moles Town?

CUT TO: MOLES TOWN - SHACK

LITTLEFINGER is standing in the center of the room. SANSA and BRIENNE enter. LITTLEFINGER turns to greet them.

LITTLEFINGER: Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.

SANSA: Unharmed? What are you doing here?

LITTLEFINGER: I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. Theyre encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.

SANSA: To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didnt know, youre an idiot. If you did know, youre my enemy.

SANSA steps closer to LITTLEFINGER.

SANSA: Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Starks daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?

LITTLEFINGER: I cant begin to contemplate --

SANSA: What do you think he did to me?

BRIENNE: Lady Sansa asked you a question.

LITTLEFINGER: He beat you.

SANSA: Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?

LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I --

SANSA: What else?

LITTLEFINGER: Did he cut you?

SANSA: Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.

LITTLEFINGER: I didnt know.

SANSA: I thought you knew everyones secrets.

LITTLEFINGER: I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.

SANSA: The other things he did, ladies arent supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I dont mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.

LITTLEFINGER: Im so sorry.

SANSA: You said you would protect me.

LITTLEFINGER: And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.

SANSA: I dont believe you anymore. I dont need you anymore. You cant protect me. You wont even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldnt I?

LITTLEFINGER: Do you want me to beg for my life? If thats what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.

SANSA: What if I want you to die here and now?

LITTLEFINGER: Then I will die.

SANSA: You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.

LITTLEFINGER: I would do anything to undo whats been done to you. I know that I cant. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.

SANSA: I have an army.

LITTLEFINGER: Your brothers army.

LITTLEFINGER walks beside SANSA.

LITTLEFINGER: Half-brother.

LITTLEFINGER exits.
Heavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRANs sledge through the forest. BRANs eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA.

BRAN: Meera. They found us.

MEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.

MEERA: Im so sorry.

The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The riders horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horses bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA.

RIDER: Come with me, now.

A large group of wights approaches.

RIDER: The dead dont rest.

The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the riders hand and joins them on the horses back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.
Many men are performing various tasks pertaining to the construction of a church. Many women are preparing food.

MAN: Thats it. Get it to the top.

MAN #2: Steady. Steady.

BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log.

RAY: Up she goes.

RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.

RAY: Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?

RAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing.

RAY: Here you are, son.

The man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in.

RAY: Oh, gentlemen, please.

RAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs.

RAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.

RAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound.
LADY CRANE and CLARENZO are performing JOFFREYs death scene in The Bloody Hand. Portraying CERSEI, LADY CRANE is kneeling, cradling CLARENZOs head. The audience watches silently.

LADY CRANE: My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven Ill see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life.

The crowd cheers. LADY CRANE and CLARENZO stand and bow. LADY CRANE makes her way backstage. She takes off her wig and sits down at her table in the actors break room, wiping her eyes. She takes her bottle of rum and begins to pour herself a glass but stops when she hears a rustling from behind a clothing rack. She stands and walks over to the clothing rack, then parts the clothes. ARYA is lying on the ground behind the rack, bleeding from her stomach.

CUT TO: BRAAVOS - LADY CRANES APARTMENT

ARYA is lying in bed. LADY CRANE sits beside her, treating her wounds.

ARYA: Youre good at that. Where did you learn?

LADY CRANE: Im a jealous woman. Ive always liked bad men and theyve always liked me. Theyd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whores perfume.

LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.

LADY CRANE: So wed fight and Id put a hole in them. And then Id feel terrible, so Id patch them up. I got good at patching them up.

ARYA: And good at putting holes in them.

LADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.

LADY CRANE: And that.

ARYA: What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.

LADY CRANE: Bianca.

LADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.

LADY CRANE: Shell have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.

LADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps, then scrunches up her face.

ARYA: Mmm.

LADY CRANE: I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.

ARYA: I cant.

LADY CRANE: Why not? Got a feeling youd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.

ARYA: I dont think I could remember all of the lines.

LADY CRANE: Come with us. Whats left for you here?

ARYA: You wouldnt be safe. Not while shes looking for me.

LADY CRANE: Who?

ARYA: She doesnt have a name.

LADY CRANE: Where will you go?

ARYA: Essos is east and Westeros is west. But whats west of Westeros?

LADY CRANE: I dont know.

ARYA: Nobody does. Thats where all the maps stop.

LADY CRANE: The edge of the world, maybe.

ARYA: Id like to see that.

ARYA is afflicted with pain from her wound. LADY CRANE stands and pours a milky white liquid into a glass.

ARYA: Whats that?

LADY CRANE: Milk of the poppy.

ARYA: I dont want any.

LADY CRANE hands ARYA the glass.

LADY CRANE: Sleep is the only way youll heal. Trust me, if my soup didnt kill you, nothing will.

ARYA takes the glass, stares into it, and then drinks it down. She lays back and LADY CRANE tucks her in. ARYA falls asleep. LADY CRANE touches her hand and dims the candlelight.
The Masters men are launching flaming projectiles at the Great Pyramid and surrounding city from their ships. DAENERYS watches from atop a balcony of the Great Pyramid. She returns to the interior, to the conference room where TYRION awaits. DAENERYS approaches him. An explosion occurs outside.

TYRION: Despite appearances, I think youll find the citys on the rise.

An explosion occurs outside.

TYRION: Perhaps we should take shelter.

An explosion occurs outside.

DAENERYS: The city is on the rise?

TYRION: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.

An explosion occurs outside.

TYRION: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters

An explosion occurs outside.

TYRION: ...it proves that no one needs a Master.

DAENERYS: Good. Shall we begin?

TYRION: Do we have a plan?

DAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.

TYRION tightens his jaw and looks away.

DAENERYS: You dont approve?

TYRION: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for Kings Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

An explosion occurs outside.

TYRION: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. Thats why Jaime killed him.

DAENERYS: This is entirely different.

TYRION: Youre talking about destroying cities. Its not entirely different. Id like to suggest an alternate approach.

A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window.

CUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU

DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers.

RAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slavers Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.

TYRION: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.

YEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.

DAENERYS: We obviously didnt communicate clearly. Were here to discuss your surrender, not mine.

RAZDAL: I imagine its difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.

DAENERYS: My reign has just begun.

A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen.

CUT TO: MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCE

A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy.

CUT TO: MEEREEN - HARBOR

DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what theyre doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.

DAENERYS: Dracarys.

The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.

CUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU

GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters soldiers.

GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice:

The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters soldiers ready their swords.

GREY WORM: ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.

A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters soldiers lay down their arms and run away.

TYRION: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.

MISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.

TYRION: It always seems a bit abstract, doesnt it, other people dying?

RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN.

RAZDAL: Him. He should die.

BELICHO: Yes, him.

TYRION looks at GREY WORM.

RAZDAL: Hes not one of us. Hes an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.

GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.

YEZZAN: Please.

YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHOs throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.

TYRION: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away.
CERSEI is standing at the balcony looking out across Kings Landing at the Great Sept of Baelor.

The attendant places TOMMENs crown on top of his head. TOMMEN looks out the window.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

A pair of Faith Militant men open the main door to the Sept. A crowd of nobles filters inside.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - LORAS CELL

LORAS sits in the back of his cell, muttering to himself. LANCEL and two other Faith Militant enter. LORAS cowers. The Faith Militant take hold of LORAS.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

The HIGH SPARROW and six other septons enter. They walk down the steps. MARGAERY appears in the crowd beside her father, MACE. She and the HIGH SPARROW exchange a glance as he walks by. The HIGH SPARROW and the other septons occupy seven chairs seated in a circle around the central chamber of the sept. MARGAERY looks around.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMENs CHAMBER

TOMMEN is sitting in a chair in the center of the room, looking out the window. His attendant enters.

ATTENDANT: Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

A handmaiden connects a golden chain between two golden shoulder fastenings on CERSEIs dress.

TOMMEN says nothing. The attendant leaves.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

The handmaiden places a ring on CERSEIs middle finger.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLES CHAMBER

PYCELLE is standing in front of a bureau. He picks up a piece of paper and reads it, then picks up his chain, places it around his neck, and looks in the mirror. A mistress lying on his bed stares at him in the reflection of the mirror.

MISTRESS: You got my money?

PYCELLE: Later. Go away.

The mistress stands and leaves. PYCELLE straightens himself out, sighs, and exits the room. In the hallway, he walks down a set of steps. A young girl appears on the steps behind him.

GIRL: Grand Maester.

PYCELLE turns back to look at her and walks over to her. He bends down and she whispers into his ear.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant usher LORAS into the sept and down the steps. His hair has been shorn. MARGAERY stares at him. The Faith Militant lead him to the center of the room and move away. The HIGH SPARROW stands.

HIGH SPARROW: Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?

LORAS: Therell be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.

HIGH SPARROW: To which crimes will you be confessing?

LORAS: All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

The crowd murmurs.

LORAS: I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.

HIGH SPARROW: The gods judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.

LORAS kneels.

LORAS: I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.

HIGH SPARROW: You understand fully what this means?

LORAS: I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.

HIGH SPARROW: Brother Loras

LORAS begins to cry.

HIGH SPARROW: ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.

The HIGH SPARROW touches LORAS face. LORAS looks up at him.

HIGH SPARROW: Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?

LORAS: I will.

The HIGH SPARROW smiles. The HIGH SPARROW nods. Two Faith Militant approach LORAS and take him by the arms. A third approaches him from behind, draws a knife, and begins carving the mark of the Seven into LORAS forehead. MACE stirs.

MACE: No, I cant let them

MARGAERY blocks her father with her arm.

MARGAERY: Faith is the way, Father.

LORAS whinces.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

The handmaiden finishes dressing CERSEI and steps away from her.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMENS CHAMBER

Someone approaches TOMMEN.

TOMMEN: All right. Im ready.

TOMMEN stands and turns around. GREGOR is standing in the doorway.

TOMMEN: I have to go, Im-- Im late for the trial.

TOMMEN walks towards GREGOR. GREGOR puts his hand on TOMMENs shoulder, blocking his path.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

The handmaiden exits. CERSEI looks over her shoulder.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

The Faith Militant has finished carving LORASs forehead. KEVAN watches from the crowd. MARGAERY has made her way to the floor in front of the HIGH SPARROW.

MARGAERY: You mutilated him. You gave me your word.

HIGH SPARROW: Ive kept my word. Once the queen mothers trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.

MARGAERY: And where is the queen mother?

LANCEL: Her litter never left the Red Keep.

HIGH SPARROW: It appears the queen mother doesnt wish to attend her own trial.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

CERSEI pours herself a glass of wine.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

HIGH SPARROW (to LANCEL): Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS

LANCEL emerges onto the steps with the Faith Militant. He sees a boy running down the steps. The boy looks over his shoulder at LANCEL.

LANCEL: Get the others.

The other Faith Militant disperse. LANCEL looks over the railing and sees the boy enter a door at the foot of the steps.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURNS LAB

The young girl opens the door and leads PYCELLE inside. PYCELLE looks around.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS

LANCEL runs to the door the boy entered and then goes inside. It leads to a tunnel. LANCEL sees the boy running down the tunnel with a lit torch. He starts after the boy.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURNS LAB

PYCELLE walks down the steps and into the lab, then turns around to see QYBURN sitting in a chair behind him.

PYCELLE: Wheres the king?

QYBURN stands.

QYBURN: Elsewhere, Im afraid.

PYCELLE: Whats the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--

QYBURN: Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.

PYCELLE turns around. A young boy emerges from the shadows with a knife.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL continues to follow the boy through the tunnels.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURNS LAB

More children brandishing knives appear.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL runs down the tunnel after the boy.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURNS LAB

QYBURN: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.

The girl who led PYCELLE into the room brandishes a knife.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL turns a corner and finds a smaller tunnel. He gets down on his hands and knees and crawls through it.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURNS LAB

The children converge on PYCELLE. PYCELLE slaps one of them but is overwhelmed. The children stab him repeatedly with their knives, killing him. QYBURN watches.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL happens upon the boys torch and raises it up.

LANCEL: The longer you wait, the worse itll be for you.

LANCEL spies a side passageway lined with barrels. The boy sneaks up on him and stabs him in the side. LANCEL yells and falls to the ground. The boy runs away. LANCEL breathes heavily. The boy returns and looks at LANCEL.

LANCEL: What are you doing?

The boy runs away.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

The crowd is murmuring. MARGAERY looks around at them, then looks at LORAS. LORAS is hanging his head, his eyes downcast.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL looks down the tunnel and sees a glimmer of light. He drags himself through the dirt towards it.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

CERSEI is standing at the balcony, staring out at the Great Sept of Baelor.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

MARGAERY looks around.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL crawls closer to the other end of the hall. There is a green glow all around him.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

MARGAERY hurries over to the HIGH SPARROW.

MARGAERY: Theres something wrong.

HIGH SPARROW: You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.

MARGAERY: Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?

HIGH SPARROW: If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--

MARGAERY: Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what Im telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

The HIGH SPARROW scoffs and shakes his head.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL has almost reached the end of the tunnel. He sees green pools of liquid on the ground in front of two barrels with candles in their centers. The candles have almost burned down to nothing. He looks around at the casks lining the walls of the tunnel and pulls himself onward towards the candles.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

MARGAERY (to the crowd): We all need to leave now!

MARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.

MARGAERY: Loras. Stay with me.

MARGAERY ushers him towards the steps.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL groans as he pulls himself closer to the candles.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

MARGAERY hurries towards the exit with LORAS. The crowd begins to panic and also heads towards the exit. Two Faith Militant block MARGAERYs path to the exit.

MARGAERY: Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.

MARGAERY pushes against the guards. The HIGH SPARROW looks around at the crowd.

MARGAERY: Let us through!

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

LANCEL reaches the candles. He tries to blow out the flame with his breath, but it wont go out.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

MARGAERY looks over her shoulder at the HIGH SPARROW. They stare into each others eyes.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS

The flame from the candle touches the pool of green liquid and ignites it. The surrounding barrels are ignited and explode in a mass of green flame. LANCEL is incinerated. The explosion travels down the tunnel, igniting all of the barrels.

CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR

The sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept, incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept, killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion. The bell from its tower is flung down into the city, smashing into a bystander. The flames rush out from the sept.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEIS CHAMBER

CERSEI watches the explosion. She cocks her head back, then smiles, sips her wine, and walks away.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMENS CHAMBER

GREGOR is standing in the hallway.TOMMEN is staring out the window at the explosion with his mouth hanging open. GREGOR exits.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER

SEPTA UNELLA is lying strapped to a table. CERSEI stands over her and pours wine in her face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles against her bindings.

CERSEI: Confess. Confess.

CERSEI raises a pitcher of wine over SEPTA UNELLAs head.

SEPTA UNELLA: No.

CERSEI: Confess.

CERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLAs face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty, SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air.

CERSEI: Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didnt do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.

CERSEI touches SEPTA UNELLAs face.

CERSEI: Youve always been quiet.

CERSEI walks around the table.

CERSEI: I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?

SEPTA UNELLA: Good. Im glad to see your face. Im ready to meet the gods.

CERSEI: What? Now? Today? Youre not going to die today. Youre not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.

GREGOR enters the room.

CERSEI: This is Ser Gregor Clegane. Hes quiet, too.

SEPTA UNELLA looks at GREGOR. GREGOR removes his helmet. His face is cloaked in shadow.

CERSEI: Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.

CERSEI walks towards the exit. GREGOR enters. His face is purple and mangled. He puts his helmet down on the table next to SEPTA UNELLA.

SEPTA UNELLA: No.

SEPTA UNELLA struggles against her bindings, then cries out in pain.

CERSEI: Shame.

CERSEI take hold of the door and closes it behind her.

CERSEI: Shame.

SEPTA UNELLA screams.

CERSEI: Shame.

CERSEI closes the latch on the doors porthole and walks away. SEPTA UNELLA screams.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMENS CHAMBER

TOMMEN is staring out the window.

ATTENDANT: Im very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry.

The attendant exits. TOMMEN takes his crown off his head and walks to another part of the room. He returns to the window, stands up on the sill, and plummets off the edge.
The Freys are all gathered in the hall. WALDER FREY sits at the high table. WALDER slams his cup down on the table twice. The room grows silent. WALDER stands.

WALDER FREY: You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

The Freys laugh.

WALDER FREY: Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!

The Freys cheer and slam their fists on their tables. WALDER snaps his fingers at a servant girl. The girl begins serving flasks of wine.

WALDER FREY: I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!

The Freys cheer. WALDER raises his glass.

WALDERY FREY: Stand together!

The Freys stand in unison.

ALL: Stand together!

The Freys drink. WALDER holds his cup to his lips but does not drink. The servant girl picks up her cup and motions to drink.

WALDER: Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.

WALDER addresses the hall again.

WALDER: Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

The Freys cheer.

WALDER: Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.

Some of the Freys groan.

WALDER: No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.

The Freys choke, cough, and spit up blood.

WALDER: Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.

The Freys collapse and die. WALDER takes hold of his own face and removes it, revealing ARYA's face. ARYA turns to the servant girl.

ARYA: When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.

ARYA walks through the hall, staring at the Frey bodies. She smiles and exits.
A storm rages. Rain falls on the beach and the castle, lightning flashes, and thunder crackles overhead. DAENERYS TARGARYEN, TYRION LANNISTER, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and VARYS are standing in the Chamber of the Painted Table, staring out at the storm.

TYRION: On a night like this, you came into the world.

VARYS: I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.

DAENERYS: I wish I could remember it.

DAENERYS turns away from the window and walks over to the table.

DAENERYS: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.

TYRION: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

DAENERYS: Good.

DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table

DAENERYS: Not so many lions.

VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...

DAENERYS: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?

DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.

DAENERYS: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.

DAENERYS picks up a dragon figurine from the table.

DAENERYS: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.

TYRION: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

DAENERYS: No.

DAENERYS puts down the dragon figurine.

TYRION: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.

DAENERYS looks at VARYS.

DAENERYS: I never properly thanked you for that.

VARYS: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.

DAENERYS: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

VARYS: I did.

DAENERYS: And then you served the man who overthrew him?

VARYS: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.

DAENERYS: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.

VARYS: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.

DAENERYS: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.

TYRION: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--

DAENERYS (to VARYS): Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?

VARYS: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.

DAENERYS: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

VARYS: Which you turned to your advantage.

DAENERYS: Who gave the order to kill me?

VARYS: King Robert.

DAENERYS: Who hired the assassins?

DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.

DAENERYS: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

VARYS: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--

DAENERYS: To keep yourself alive.

TYRION: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

DAENERYS: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?

VARYS: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.

DAENERYS: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

VARYS: I swear it, my queen.

DAENERYS: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.

VARYS smiles.

VARYS: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.

GREY WORM: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.

CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM

MELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room. DAENERYS enters, accompanied by TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM. They approach MELISANDRE.

MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian.

MELISANDRE:  Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.

DAENERYS:  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?

MELISANDRE:  I am called Melisandre.

VARYS begins speaking English.

VARYS:  She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

MELISANDRE:  No, it didn't.

DAENERYS:  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.

DAENERYS turns to look at Varys.

DAENERYS:  We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.

VARYS bows his head to DAENERYS.  DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.

DAENERYS:  The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?

MELISDANDRE:  Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.

DAENERYS:  What does your Lord expect from me?

MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again.

MELISANDRE:  The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.

DAENERYS speaking in English.

DAENERYS:  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

MISSANDEI:  Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.

TYRION:  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

DAENERYS:  No, but I like it better.

DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.

DAENERYS:  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

MELISANDRE:  Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a roll to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow.

TYRION:  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?

DAENERYS:  You know him?

TYRION:  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.

VARYS:  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?

MELISANDRE:  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.

DAENERYS:  He sounds like quite a man.

MELISANDRE:  Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.

TYRION:  I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.

DARNERYS smiles at Tyrion.

TYRION:  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

DAENERYS pauses for a moment.

DAENERYS:  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Young boys and girls are practicing archery.  JON, SANSA and DAVOS stand on the upper level watching the training.

SANSA:  Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.

JON:  Read the last bit.

SANSA:  "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."  What does that mean?

JON:  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?

SANSA:  Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."

DAVOS:  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.

DAVOS pauses to ponder something.

JON:  What?

DAVOS:  Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?

SANSA:  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

DAVOS:  No, too dangerous.

JON:  But?

DAVOS:  But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?

JON gazes back to the courtyard looking concerned.

CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONEROOM

CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne.  She is surrounded by JAIME, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN and members of her Queensguard.  Many lords are in attendance including RANDYLL TARLEY.

CERSEI:  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.

The lords begin murmuring amongst themselves.

CERSEI:  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.

The lords murmur louder

CERSEI:  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.

RANDYLL TARLEY slowly approaches the throne.

RANDYLL:  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?

CERSEI glances over to QYBURN.

QYBURN:  We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.

The meeting disbands.  All the lords walk out into the hall outside of the throne room.  JAIME approaches RANDYLL TARLEY and begins to walk with him.

JAIME:  Lord Tarley.

RANDYLL:  Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son.

DICKON:  Ser, Jaime.

JAIME:  Rickon, isn't it?

DICKON:  Dickon.

JAIME:  That's it.

JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll

JAIME:  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.

RANDYLL:  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.

JAIME and RANDYLL walk to an unoccupied hallway and continue their conversation.

JAIME:  Do you ride for Hornhill today?

RANDYLL:  I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.

JAIME:  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --

RANDYLL:  It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?

JAIME:  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.

RANDYLL:  Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

JAIME:  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.

RANDYLL:  I've known Olenna since I was a child.

JAIME:  She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?

RANDYLL nods his head in agreement

JAIME:  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.

CUT TO:  CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS

ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room.  JORAH's upper body is covered in Greyscale except his face.

MARWYN:  The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.

JORAH:  How long?

MARWYN:  It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20.

JORAH:  But how long 'till...

MARWYN:  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer.

JORAH sighs and sits down on his bed.  SAMWELL approaches MARWYN.

SAMWELL: Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --

MARWYN:  Does this look like a baby to you?

SAMWELL:  No.

MARWYN:  Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?

SAMWELL:  No.

MARWYN:  Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

MARWYN turns to face JORAH.

MARWYN:  This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you.

JORAH nods his head.  MARWYN turns to leave the room and begins walking to the door.

MARWYN:  Come, Samwell.

SAMWELL:  Should we send word to your family, Ser...

JORAH:  Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.

SAMWELL:  Mormont?

JORAH:  There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.

MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway

MARWYN:  Come, Samwell.

SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room.  He closes the door to the quarantine room.

CUT TO:  UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS

QYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls.

QYBURN:  Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?

CERSEI:  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.

QYBURN:  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.

CERSEI:  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

QYBURN and CERSEI arrive at the end of the dungeon.  They are looking at the largest dragon skull in the room.

QYBURN:  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible.

QYBURN turns and starts walking away from the dragon skull.

QYBURN:  Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed.

QYBURN walks up to a machine covered by a cloth.  He reaches up and removes the cloth revealing an artillery-sized crossbow aimed at Balerion's skull.

QYBURN:  The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever.

CERSEI releases a lever on the machine and launches a giant bolt directly into Balerion's eye socket.  The bolt buries deep into the skull and gets stuck.  CERSEI stands behind the machine smirking.

CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE

DAENERYS, YARA GREYJOY, THEON GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND, OLENNA TYRELL, VARYS, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER are standing around a carved table of Westeros having a discussion.

YARA:  If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day.

TYRION:  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

ELLARIA looks at TYRION with disgust.

ELLARIA:  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.

TYRION:    I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.

ELLARIA:  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.

DAENERYS:  That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.

DAENERYS pauses for a moment.

DAENERYS:  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

OLENNA addresses DAENERYS from across the table.

OLENNA:  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you.

DAENERYS:  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing.

OLEANNA:  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?

DAENERYS:  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.

TYRION:  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

TYRION begins walking around the carved table of Westeros.

TYRION:  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.

ELLIA:  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?

TYRION:  You are.

TYRION reaches down and picks up a figurine that resembles a Kraken in a longship.

TYRION:  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.

TYRION walks to the south of the map and picks up a figurine that resembles a sun.  He takes both figurines and places them at King's Landing.

TYRION:  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

OLENNA:  So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?

TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet.  He begins walking back around the map of Westeros.

TYRION:  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.

TYRION stops in front of Casterly Rock.  There is a figurine that resembles a lion.  He knocks the lion over with the Unsullied figurine.  Everyone in the room nods in agreement.

DAENERYS:  Do I have your support?

YARA:  You have mine.

ELLIA:  Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

Lady Olenna nods her head in agreement.

DAENERYS:  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

Everyone except DAENERYS and OLENNA leave the Chamber of the Painted Table.  DAENERYS walks to the end and sits next to OLENNA.

DAENERYS:  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.

OLENNA:  Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?

DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement

OLENNA:  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon.

CUT TO - DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS

GREY WORM is sitting sharpening his sword.  Someone knocks on his door.  He begins speaking Valyrian.

GREY WORM:   Enter.

MISSANDEI walks in.  She speaks in English.

MISSANDEI:  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?

GREY WORM:  I will see you when I return.

MISSANDEI:  But you don't know when that will be.

GREYWORM:  No one knows.

MISSANDEI:  I wish you good fortune.

MISSANDEI turns and starts to walk out of the room.

GREY WORM:  Missandei --

MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM.

GREY WORM:  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

MISSANDEI:  Why?

GREY WORM:  You know why.

MISSANDEI:  I don't.

GREY WORM:  You are my weakness.

MISSANDEI appears offended.

MISSANDEI:  That's what I am?  Your weakness?

GREY WORM:  When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.

MISSANDEI:  I believe it.

GREY WORM:  Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.

MISSANDEI:  I do too.

GREY WORM steps forward and kisses MISSANDEI.  MISSANDEI grabs his hands and stops him.  She begins to undress herself.  MISSANDEI steps forward and begins to undress GREY WORM.

GREY WORM:  No.

MISSANDEI:  I want to see you.  Please.

GREY WORM hesitates for a moment, then nods his head in agreement.  MISSANDEI finishes undressing GREY WORM.  Sex scene ensues.

CUT TO - CITADEL LIBRARY

MARWYN and SAMWELL are walking by various shelves in the library.  SAMWELL is carrying a stack of books for MARWYN.

MARWYN:  It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.

SAMWELL:  Archmaester, I wanted to --

MARWYN:  And this one.

MARWYN places another book on the stack SAMWELL is carrying.

MARWYN:  Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.

MARWYN continues walking

SAMWELL:  I wanted to ask you --

MARWYN:  If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.

SAMWELL says nothing.

MARWYN: What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?

SAMWELL:  Possibly something a bit more poetic?

MARWYN:  We're not poets, Tarley.

SAMWELL:  Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.

MARWYN:  This is your moment.  Use it wisely.

MARWYN begins looking through books on the shelf.

SAMWELL:  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.

MARWYN places a book on SAMWELL's stack.  He continues looking at more books.

MARWYN:  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.

SAMWELL:  Oh, you are?

MARWYN:  Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.

MARWYN places another book on SAMWELL's stack.

SAMWELL:  Oh.

MARWYN:  The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.

MARWYN turns and walks out of the library.

CUT TO: QUARANTINE ROOMS

A few hours have passed.  JORAH is writing a letter to DAENERYS by candlelight in his quarantine room.  He hears a noise in the hallway and stands to face the door.  SAMWELL opens the door and rolls in a cart filled with medical tools and containers.

SAMWELL:  Hello.

JORAH:  What are you doing?

SAMWELL:  You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.

SAMWELL picks up a roll of leather and sets it on the table.  He unrolls it revealing an assortment of scalpels and knives.

SAMWELL:  My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah.

SAMWELL picks up a large flask and hands it to JORAH.

SAMWELL:  Drink this.

JORAH:  What is it?

SAMWELL:  Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

JORAH reaches for the bottle.  SAMWELL grabs it back and drinks some himself before handing it back to JORAH.  JORAH drains the flask.  SAMWELL picks up a thick book from the medical cart and sets it on the table.

SAMWELL:  If you could take off your shirt.

SAMWELL gives JORAH a strap made of leather.

SAMWELL:  If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.

JORAH:  Have you ever done this before?

SAMWELL:  No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --

JORAH looks at SAMWELL to stop him from explaining.  SAMWELL picks up a pair of tweezers and a scalpel.  He grabs a section of Greyscale to cut it off.  JORAH recoils in pain.

SAMWELL:  Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream.

SAMWELL cuts into the Greyscale.  JORAH begins to writhe in agony and whimper.  Pus is dripping from the wound.  SAMWELL continues cutting and slices a layer of Greyscale off JORAH's skin.

CUT TO:  INN AT THE CROSSROADS

Two men are at a table having a conversation.

MAN #1:  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.

MAN #2:  Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us.

MAN #1:  If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.

The camera zooms out showing Arya eavesdropping on the men.

MAN #2:  As long as we get back there before they start.

MAN #1:  One more round.  It's a long ride.

A waiter approaches Arya's table.

HOT PIE:  Ary!

ARYA:  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?

Arya reaches over and grabs a potpie from the tray and starts eating it.

ARYA:  Mmm.  This is good.

HOT PIE:    You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.

ARYA:  I didn't do that.

HOT PIE:  You've been making pies?

ARYA:  One or two.

HOT PIE:  I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?

ARYA:  Big lady?

HOT PIE:  The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?

ARYA:  She found me.

HOT PIE:  What happened to you Ary?

ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE.

ARYA:  You got any ale?

Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray.  Arya reaches over and grabs it before him, pouring herself a cup.

HOT PIE:  Where are you heading?

ARYA:  King's Landing.

HOT PIE:  Why?

ARYA:  I heard Cersei's queen now.

HOT PIE:  I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.

ARYA:  Hmm.

Arya nods in agreement.

HOT PIE:  I can't believe someone could do that.

ARYA:  Cersei would do that.

HOT PIE:  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

ARYA:  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.

HOT PIE:  No.  The Boltons are dead.

Arya stops eating and drops her food.

ARYA:  What?

HOT PIE:  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.

ARYA:  You're lying.

HOT PIE:  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?

ARYA starts picking up her things to leave.

ARYA:  Thanks for the pie.

Arya reaches to her side and produces a bag of gold.  She starts to open the pouch.

HOT PIE:  Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.

ARYA:  Thanks.

Arya stands and walks past Hot Pie.  She turns and puts her hand on his shoulder.

ARYA:  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.

HOT PIE:  No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor.

ARYA turns and exits the Inn

CUT TO:  EXT. INN AT THE CROSSROADS

ARYA climbs on her horse.  She looks towards the south, then the north.  She makes a decision and turns around to head back north.  She rides off into the distance.

CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS

JON is bent over his desk looking at maps.  There's a knock at the door.

JON:  Come in.

WOLKAN:  A raven, My King, from the Citadel.

JON begins reading the scroll.

CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL

The room is filled with northern lords and ladies including SANSA, JON, BRIENNE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE, and PETER BAELISH.  JON is standing in the great hall holding a message up for the lords to see.

JON:  This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.

The lords murmur amongst themselves.  JON hands the first note to ROBETT GLOVER.  JON holds up a different note for the lords to see.

JON:  I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

The lords murmur louder.

JON:  He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.

The lords speak among themselves and look concerned.

JON:  Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.

There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall

JON:  We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

The lords nod in agreement

JON:  But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.

SANSA:  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.

JON:  I know that.

SANSA:  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.

JON:  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man.

YOHN ROYCE stands up and turns to face JON.

YOHN ROYCE:  Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.

The lords shout in agreement.

ROBETT GLOVER:  We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.

LYANNA MORMONT:  Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north.

The lords pound the tables in agreement.

JON:  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it.

SANSA:  Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.

JON:  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.

SANSA:  You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.

JON:  I'm leaving both in good hands.

SANSA:  Whose?

JON:  Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT

JON stands in the torchlit crypt looking at a statue of Ned Stark.  LORD BAELISH approaches him.

BAELISH:  I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.

Baelish looks up at the statue of Ned Stark.

BAELISH:  I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm.

JON turns to face BAELISH.

JON:  You don't belong down here.

BAELISH:  Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.

JON:  I have nothing to say to you.

BAELISH:  Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother.

JON grabs BAELISH by the throat and pushes him against the wall.  BAELISH begins choking.

JON:  Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.

JON releases BAELISH.  JON turns and walks to exit the crypt.

CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

JON walks into the courtyard towards his horse.  SER DAVOS is seated on his own horse awaiting him.  JON climbs onto his horse and looks back.  He sees SANSA on the upper level of the courtyard.  JON waves goodbye and SANSA waves back.  JON, DAVOS and Winterfell guards ride out of the gate and exit the courtyard.  BAELISH exits from the crypt looking shaken.

CUT TO:  RIVERLANDS

ARYA is building a fire.  Her horse is tied to a tree.  The horse begins to whinny.  ARYA stands and grabs her sword from beside the fire.  Multiple wolves come from the woods and begin to circle her.  A large grey and white dire wolf approaches her barring teeth.

ARYA:  Nymeria?

ARYA sets her sword down and begins to approach the dire wolf.

ARYA:  Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me.

ARYA stretches her hand out towards the dire wolf.

ARYA:  Come with me.

The dire wolf turns and begins to leave.  All the other wolves walk away with it.  ARYA whispers to herself.

ARYA:  That's not you.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE

It's nighttime.  There are dozens of ships sailing on the Sea of Dorne.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP

ELLARIA SAND's daughters TYENE, OBARA, and NYMERIA are laying in hammocks next to each other having a conversation.

NYMERIA:  You can't have them all.  It's not fair.

OBARA:  I'm oldest.

TYENE:  Momma will want Cersei for herself.

OBARA:  She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.

NYMERIA:  The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.

TYENE: Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.

OBARA:  Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma.

OBARA begins mocking TYENE.

TYENE:  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.

OBARA and NYMERIA mock TYENE in unison.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND are seated at a table drinking together.  THEON GREYJOY is standing next to them.

ELLARIA:  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?

YARA:  A few times.  Never stayed long.

ELLARIA:   A boy in every port?

YARA:  A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port.

ELLARIA:  Could we get some more?

ELLARIA hands her empty cup back to THEON.

YARA:  I thought it wasn't for you.

ELLARIA:  I'm developing a taste for it.

YARA looks at THEON

YARA:  He's not your servant.

THEON:  It's fine.

THEON begins filling the cup from a barrel of wine.

ELLARIA:  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.

YARA:  Once I kill my uncle.

ELLARIA:  And what will you be, handsome?

ELLARIA stands and gropes THEON.

THEON:  Whatever my queen demands.

YARA:  He'll be my advisor, my protector.

ELLARIA:  Oh, I see.  Your protector.

ELLARIA slowly walks towards YARA.

ELLARIA:  So if someone gets too close to you --

YARA:  He might have to intervene.

ELLARIA:  -- hold that person back.

YARA:  Until they've made their intentions known.

ELLARIA sits next to YARA and spreads her legs apart, then looks at THEON.

ELLARIA:  Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.

A large crash is heard and the ship rocks back and forth.  YARA turns to ELLARIA.

YARA:  Stay here.

YARA stands, picks up her sword and rushes for the stairs to the upper deck.  THEON follows her.

CUT TO: SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP

YARA climbs onto the deck and sees mayhem.  There are flaming arrows and flares in the sky.  YARA turns to survey the madness.  A ship bearing the Greyjoy sigil comes sailing out of the smoke and fog directly at YARA's ship.

YARA:  Euron.

EURON'S ship crashes into YARA's.  An armored gang plank is dropped onto YARA's ship.  Euron Greyjoy is riding on top of the plank as it crashes onto YARA's ship.  A sailor is crushed in the process.  Euron boards YARA's boat and begins cutting men down with an ax and laughing maniacally.  Dozens of men are rushing behind him to board YARA'S ship.  YARA and THEON both yell and leap into battle.  Many people are killed instantly.  More men are running over the gang plank.  TYENE SAND comes from below deck.  She throws a dagger and lodges it in an invader's eye.  She moves to the body to retrieve her knife.  YARA approaches her and kneels beside her.

YARA:  Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe.

TYENE nods in agreement.  She stands up and heads down into the captain's quarters.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

TYENE walks down the stairs and sees her mother, ELLARIA SAND.  TYENE runs to her mother and hugs her.  Immediately three men climb down the stairs and surround the women.  TYENE begins striking at the invaders with her knife.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP

THEON is fighting several men with his sword.  He cuts down two men and looks at YARA.  YARA looks around her at the scene.  Severel ships are engulfed in flames.  Flaming arrows are streaking in and men are shouting.  A flaming bolt flies through the air and hits YARA's mast causing it to burst into flames.  More men are rushing from EURON'S boat onto the deck.  YARA is slowly walking and watching the scene unfold.  She then turns and continues fighting.  EURON is cutting through men with ease.  He has just killed another when a whip lashes around his throat.  NYMERIA pulls on the whip and brings EURON towards her.  Euron turns and punches her in the face.  OBARA comes from behind EURON and stabs him in his arm.  He is knocked to the ground but quickly regains his feet.  They continue fighting

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

TYENE is still fighting the men.  She slices one man and stabs another in the testicles.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP

OBARA attempts to attack EURON again.  He blocks her attack and disarms her spear.  EURON grabs her by the throat and headbutts her then pushes her to her knees.  He rams her spear through her stomach and lifts her off the ground.  NYMERIA turns and sees her sister and screams, running at EURON.  She whips him several times but EURON graps the end of the whip and pulls NYMERIA towards him.  She is attacking with a knife.  EURON punches her and knocks her down.  EURON then takes NYMERIA'S whip and wraps it around her throat choking her.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

TYENE is now getting overpowered by the men.  They punch her and grab her from behind.  One of the men walks to ELLARIA and grabs her.

ELLARIA:  Kill us!  Get it over with!

The man in charge smirks at ELLARIA and shakes his head.  The men begin to push ELLARIA and TYENE upstairs to take them as hostages.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP

Nearly every ship in YARA's fleet is burning.  There are flaming bolts in the sky.  YARA spots EURON below her.  She jumps from the upper deck and knocks EURON down.  He gets back up.

EURON:  Give your uncle a kiss.

YARA quickly steps forward and slaps EURON.  They begin fighting.  YARA is being overpowered by EURON.

EURON:  Theon!

THEON is still fighting.  He hears his uncle's yell and turns to look.  EURON is holding YARA and has his ax to her neck.  THEON stops and is frozen in place.  EURON begins smirking at him.

EURON:  Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her.

THEON is looking around.  Men are being killed and everything is on fire.  One invader is pulling someone's teeth out.  THEON begins to shake and whimper.  His eye twitches.  He turns, drops his sword and jumps off of the rail of the ship into the water.  EURON begins to laugh and look at YARA.

CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE

THEON is in the water holding onto some flotsam.  He is watching the ships burn and the Iron Fleet sail away into the distance.

Beyond The Wall

INT. DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE

The camera floats over the painted table showing detailed carvings of rivers, holdfasts, and cities.  A fire burns in the hearth.

CUT TO:  BEYOND THE WALL

A raiding party consisting of JON SNOW, TORMUND, GENDRY BRATHEON, JORAH MORMONT, SANDOR CLEGANE, BERIC DONDARRIAN, THOROS of MYR and several Wildlings are ranging beyond the wall of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.  The men trek through a frozen valley filled with jagged rocks.  The Wildlings are pulling a sled loaded with gear and provisions.  The camera shifts and the men are climbing a steep mountain covered in snow.

JON(to Gendry):  Are you all right?

GENDRY faces JON and grunts.

JON:  Ever been north before?

GENDRY:  Never seen snow before.

TORMUND:  Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit.

JON:  You've never been down south.

TORMUND:  I've been to Winterfell.

JON:  That's the north.

The group of men continue north.  A Wildling scout is ahead of the group surveying the area.

GENDRY(to TORMUND):  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?

TORMUND:  You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.

JON:  There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.

TORMUND turns to look at JON and GENDRY.

TORMUND:  We have to make due with what we've got.

JON glances at GENDRY.  GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.

TORMUND:  This one is maybe not so smart.

JON:  Davos says he is a strong fighter.

TORMUND:  Good.  That's more important than being smart.

TORMUND looks at JON as they continue to walk.

TORMUND:  Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?

JON:  She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

TORMUND:  You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?

The camera pans out to a frozen vista.  The men are walking across broken slabs of ice and tundra.  There are mountains and a lake of ice in the distance.  The view shifts to GENDRY walking along with THOROS, BERIC and SANDOR.  THOROS is carrying his wine flask.

THOROS:  Are you still mad at us, boy?

GENDRY:  You sold me to a witch.

THOROS:  Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

BERIC:  We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.

GENDRY:  I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --

SANDOR:  Sounds all right so far.

GENDRY:  -- and put leeches on me.

SANDOR:  Was she naked too?

THOROS:  She needed your blood.

GENDRY:  Yes. Thank you.  I know that.

SANDOR steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.

SANDOR:  It could have been worse.

GENDRY:  She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --

SANDOR:  But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?

GENDRY:  I'm not whinging.

SANDOR:  Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.

SANDOR motions to BERIC.

SANDOR:  This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.

SANDOR walks away to join the group.  BERIC and THOROS smile to each other.  THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.

THOROS:  Good lad.

The camera shifts to the head of the line.  JON is walking with JORAH.

JON:  The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.

JORAH:  He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?

JON:  I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.

JORAH:  I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.

JON:  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.

JORAH:  Your father wanted to execute me.

JON:  I heard.

JORAH:  He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.

JORAH and JON glance at each other.

JON:  I'm glad he didn't capture you.

JORAH:  Me too.

JON stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.

JON:  Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.

JON hands the sword to JORAH.  JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.

JON:  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

JORAH stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.

JON:  But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.

JORAH pauses, then nods at JON.

JORAH:  He gave it to you.

JON:  I'm not his son.

JORAH pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands.

JORAH:  I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.

JORAH resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.

JORAH:  I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.

CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Snow is falling into the courtyard.  The ground is covered with several inches of snow.  Several braziers are burning and a servant carries a bucket of steaming water across the grounds.  ARYA is standing on the upper level looking into the courtyard.  SANSA approaches her from behind.

ARYA:  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.

SANSA:  I remember.

ARYA:  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.

ARYA starts a slow clap.

ARYA:  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.

SANSA turns to look at ARYA.

SANSA:  What?

ARYA retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.

ARYA:  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  "Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --

SANSA:  You don't have to read it.  I remember.

ARYA:  "Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."

SANSA:  They forced me to do it.

ARYA:  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?

SANSA:  You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.

ARYA:  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.

SANSA:  They told me it was the only way to save father.

ARYA:  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.

SANSA:  You were there?

ARYA:  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.

SANSA:  And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?

ARYA:  I wanted to.

SANSA:  But you didn't.  Just like me.

ARYA:  I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.

SANSA:  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?

ARYA:  I was training.

SANSA:  Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.

ARYA:  Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot.

SANSA:  You never would have survived what I survived.

ARYA:  I guess we'll never know.

SANSA:  What are you doing to do with that letter.

ARYA:  I don't know yet.

SANSA:  Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?

ARYA:  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you.

SANSA:  Arya --

ARYA:  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

SANSA:  Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --

ARYA:  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, "But I was just a child"?

SANSA:  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.

ARYA:  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.

ARYA turns and walks away.

CUT TO: - BEYOND THE WALL

The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra.  SANDOR stops to tie a fur cover over his boot that came loose.  TORMUND approaches him.

TORMUND:  You're one big ugly dog.

SANDOR:  Fuck off.

TORMUND:  They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?

SANDOR:  I don't give two shits about Wildlings.

SANDOR looks up at TORMUND.

SANDOR:  Gingers I hate.

TORMUND:  Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.

TORMUND points and motions to SANDOR's burned face.  SANDOR slaps his hand away.

SANDOR:  Don't point your fucking finger at me.

SANDOR walks away to rejoin the group.  TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.

TORMUND:  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?

SANDOR:  I didn't trip.  I was pushed.

TORMUND:  Ever since you've been mean.

SANDOR:  Will you fuck off?

TORMUND:  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.

SANDOR stops and turns to TORMUND.

SANDOR:  Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?

TORMUND:  Dick?

SANDOR:  Cock.

TORMUND:  Ah.  Dick.  I like it.

SANDOR:  I bet you do.

SANDOR turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows.

TORMUND:  Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.

SANDOR stops and glances at TORMUND.

SANDOR:  Brienne of Tarth.

TORMUND:  You know her?

SANDOR:  You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

TORMUND:  Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.

SANDOR:  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?

TORMUND nods.

TORMUND:  You do know her.

SANDOR:  We've met.

SANDOR and TORMUND begin walking.

TORMUND:  I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.

SANDOR:  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?

TORMUND:  I'm good at killing people.

The camera shifts to the middle of the line.  JON and BERIC are walking together.

BERIC:  You don't much look like him.

JON:  Who's that?

BERIC:  Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.

JON:  You knew him?

BERIC:  Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.

JON:  I serve the north.

BERIC:  The north didn't raise you from the dead.

JON:  The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.

BERIC:  He wants you alive.

JON:  Why?

BERIC:  I don't know.

JON:  That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.

BERIC:  I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.

JON:  So what are you fighting for?

BERIC:  Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.

JON:  But we all die.

BERIC:  The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

JON:  "I am the shield that guards the realms of men."

BERIC:  Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.

JON:  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.

SANDOR stops and looks into the distance.  There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.

SANDOR:  That's what I saw in the fire.

SANDOR points towards the mountain.

SANDOR:  A mountain like an arrowhead.

THOROS:  Are you sure?

SANDOR turns to THOROS and nods his head.

SANDOR:  We're getting close.

The men start walking towards the base of the mountain.

CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE

TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire.  DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.

DAENERYS:  Do you know what I like about you?

TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS.

TYRION:  I honestly don't.

DAENERYS:  You're not a hero.

TYRION:  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.

DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.

TYRION:  I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.

DAENERYS:  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.

TYRION:  It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.

DAENERYS:  Jon Snow's not in love with me.

TYRION:  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
EXT. Outside King's Landing

GREY WORM and the unsullied stand in formation in front of King's Landing. JAIME and the Lannister forces survey them from atop the rampart. BRONN walks the length of the rampart, overseeing the men.

The camera shifts to a courtyard. The soldiers work, boiling pitch, filling barrels and rolling them up to the defensive wall.

BRONN: Oil?

SOLDIER: Pitch, my lord.

BRONN: How many barrels?

SOLDIER: 500, my lord.

BRONN: Get 500 more.

SOLDIER:  Yes, my lord.

The soldier exits and BRONN walks the wall to JAIME

BRONN: I still enjoy it when they call me "my lord."

JAIME: The thrill will fade.

BRONN: If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?

JAIME: Gold?

BRONN: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?

JAIME: Family.

BRONN: Not without a cock, you don't.

JAIME: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.

BRONN: Yet, your brother

JAIME: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.

A trumpet blares. Men shriek in the distance, accompanied by thundering hoofbeats. The Dothraki crest the hill behind the disciplined unsullied army. They are savage and shrieking. They ride through and past the unsullied.

BRONN: I think we're about to be the downtrodden.

MAN: Archers, stand tall!

MAN #2: Cover that wall!

EXT. The Sea Outside King's Landing

An Ironborn fleet rests next to the castle. More Ironborn ships approach.

CUT TO: Deck of Ironborn Ship.

TYRION, THEON and VARYSs stand on deck, looking to the distance and their ship sails in. TYRION joins JON, JORAH, MISSANDEI and JORAH on the foredeck.

JON:  How many people live here?

TYRION: A million, give or take.

JON: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?

TYRION: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.

INT. Below deck of the Ironborn Ship

SANDOR decends a staircase into a dark hold, bearing a lantern. He advances carefully and stops at a crate. He gives one knock, and the WIGHT screeches in a frenzy, shaking his crate prison. Satisfied that the WIGHT lives, SANDOR turns and exits.

INT. King's Landing

CERSEI, QYBURN and JAIME stand in a royal chamber.

CERSEI: Why isn't she with them?

QYBURN: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.

CERSEI: And the rest of them?

QYBURN: They're on their way to the dragon pit now.

CERSEI: Including our brother

QYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.

CERSEI and JAIME walk into the adjacent room, where the MOUNTAIN stands.

CERSEI:  If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastardwho calls himself king

CERSEI exits, followed by the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN and JAIME

EXT. Outside King's Landing

JON, TYRION, JORAH, MISSANDEI and DAVOS walk ahead of their Dothraki guards. VARYS, THEON and SANDOR are further back.

MISSANDEI: Why did they build it?

JORAH: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.

TYRION: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.

Lannister guards approach, led by BRONN and accompanied by BRIENNE and PODRICK.

DAVOS: Maybe it still is.

BRONN: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.

The Dothraki, led by Qhono, look suspicious. BRIENNE and SANDOR exchange a look/

BRONN: I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.

The Lannister guards part, clearing the path. TYRION nods to QHONO, who takes the lead. The Dothraki all move forward, followed by the rest. PODRICK meets TYRION.

TYRION: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.

PODRICK: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.

TYRION: Supporting the enemy, no less.

PODRICK: Hard to blame you.

TYRION: Cersei will anyway.

PODRICK: I'm glad you're alive.

BRONN: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.

TYRION: (Shakes his head.)

CUT TO: Further back on the road.

The WIGHT's crate is drawn by horses, en route to the meeting site.

SOLDIER: What's in there?

SANDOR: Fuck off.

BRIENNE: I thought you were dead.

SANDOR: Not yet. You came pretty close.

BRIENNE: I was only trying to protect her.

SANDOR: You and me both.

BRIENNE: She's alive. Arya.

SANDOR: Where?

BRIENNE: Winterfell.

SANDOR: Who's protecting her if you're here?

BRIENNE: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.

SANDOR: It won't be me.

The camera shifts forward as they travel to the meeting.

TYRION: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.

PODRICK: It is, my lord

TYRION: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

BRONN: I'm sure your new queen

TYRION: You've been thinking about our new queen

VARYS: And that would be double what now, exactly?

BRONN: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.

TYRION: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.

BRONN: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.

TYRION: It's good to see you again.

BRONN: Yeah, you, too.

CUT TO: Outside the Dragon PIt

SANDOR attends to the cart transporting the WIGHT.

SANDOR: Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.

CUT TO: The Dragon Pit

The party enters the ruin of the dragon pit. Lannister banners decorate the walls, and the stage has been furnished with open tents for the summit. Everyone files in, Lannisters to the right, Northerns to the left.

BRONN: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?

BRIENNE gives her permission to PODRICK, who exits with BRONN. JON watches them go.

JORAH and TYRION look around. SANDOR paces.

SANDOR: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?

TYRION: You might.

SANDOR: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.

TYRION: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

CERSEI enters with the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, EURON and JAIME. JON and CERSEI exchange glances. So do BRIENNE and JAIME, CERSEI and TYRION, EURON and THEON. The royal party seats themselves, and SANDOR and the MOUNTAIN exchange looks. The Cleganes walk to confront one another before the dais.

SANDOR: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother

SANDOR walks away. The MOUNTAIN watches him go, then takes his place behind Cersei.

CERSEI: Where is she?

TYRION: She'll be here soon.

CERSEI: Didn't travel with you?

TYRION: No.

Everyone waits. Then, dragons screech. JAIME and EURON stand to watch the dragons arrive.  Drogon lands powerfully next to the stage and roars. TYRION turns to look at CERSEI. JON and DAVOS look on as Drogon roars again, lowering his head to reveal DAENERYS on his back. Drogon climbs down to the dragon pit, and DAENERYS dismounts. She walks to the dais as Drogon flies away. DAENERYS and CERSEI eye one another as she takes her seat next to TYRION.

CERSEI: We've been here for some time.

DAENERYS: My apologies.

DAENERYS looks to TYRION, who stands in response.

TYRION: We are all facing a unique

EURON: Theon! I have your sister

TYRION and JAIME exchange confused glances. JAIME shakes TYRION off.

TYRION: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.

EURON: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.

EURON walks towards TYRION.

TYRION: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.

EURON: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.

JAIME: Perhaps you ought to sit down.

EURON: Why?

CERSEI: Sit down or leave.

The MOUNTAIN moves forward, threatening to enforce CERSEI's will. EURON laughs and returns to his seat. THEON watches silently.

TYRION: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.

CERSEI: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?

TYRION: We all know that will never happen.

CERSEI: Then why are we here?

JON rises and walks forward to make his case.

JON: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

CERSEI: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.

JON: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

CERSEI: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.

DAENERYS: Yes. That's all.

CERSEI: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.

DAENERYS: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.

CERSEI: The word of a would-be usurper.

TYRION: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.

SANDOR returns, bearing the crate on his back. He puts it down, removes the chains and bars that lock it. He removes the lid, and stands back in caution, grasping the hilt of his sword. Nothing happens. He kicks over the crate to reveal the WIGHT, who charges towards CERSEI, screeching horribly. SANDOR follows, while the WIGHT reaches for the frozen CERSEI. At the last minute, SANDOR pulls the chain that binds him, yanking the WIGHT off of its feet.  JAIME and the MOUNTAIN stand to protect CERSEI. The WIGHT turns its attention to SANDOR. He draws his sword, and slices the WIGHT in half as it attacks him. Both halves of the WIGHT continue to move. The upper half crawls towards SANDOR, who slices away a forearm. QYBURN picks up the undead arm to examine it. JON takes it, and with Davos's help, lights a torch.

JON:  We can destroy them by burning them.

JON sets the hand aflame, and it writhes. The WIGHT screeches helplessly. JON drops the arm.

JON: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.

JON stabs the WIGHT in the heart with his dragonglass knife, and the WIGHT falls lifeless after a final screech. CERSEI stares in disbelief, and DAENERYS watches. JON approaches CERSEI.

JON: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.

CERSEI looks to JAIME.

DAENERYS: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.

JAIME: How many?

DAENERYS: A hundred thousand, at least.

EURON rises to investigate the lifeless WIGHT.

EURON: Can they swim?

JON: No.

EURON: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.

CERSEI: What are you talking about?

EURON: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.

EURON walks over to DAENERYS.

EURON: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.

EURON exits.

CERSEI: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.

JON: (SIGHS)

CERSEI: In return, the King

DAENERYS: Just the King

CERSEI: (CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's sonI know Ned Stark's son

JON looks to DAVOS and DAENERYS.

JON: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

CERSEI: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.

CERSEI, JAIME, QYBURN and the MOUNTAIN move to leave. BRIENNE follows.

BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.

JAIME: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.

BRIENNE: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.

JAIME: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queenand you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother

BRIENNE hits JAIME on the arm

BRIENNE: Oh, fuck loyalty!

JAIME: Fuck loyalty?

BRIENNE: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen

JAIME looks to CERSEI, who turns and walks away with QYBURN.

JAIME: And tell her what?

JAIME exits.

Those that remain contemplate what has happened.

DAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.

DAENERYS: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.

JON: I know!

TYRION: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen

JON: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father

TYRION: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.

DAVOS: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?

TYRION: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister

DAENERYS: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand

TYRION: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.

JON: I did this. I should go.

TYRION:  She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister

DAENERYS: (Nods)

Tyrion exits.

CUT TO: King's Landing portico

Tyrion walks the halls of the castle, followed by the MOUNTAIN. He meets with JAIME.

TYRION: You spoke with her?

JAIME: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.

TYRION: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?

JAIME: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.

TYRION advances, and the MOUNTAIN leads him inside

CUT TO: Council Chamber.

The MOUNTAIN accompanies TYRION into the chamber to meet CERSEI.

CERSEI: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.

TYRION: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.

CERSEI: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her.

TYRION:  I didn't know about that.

CERSEI: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life

TYRION:  Cersei, I didn't know.

CERSEI: the destruction of this family.

TYRION: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.

CERSEI: You killed our father

TYRION: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.

CERSEI: Oh, poor little manYour papawas mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father

TYRION:  I have never been more sorry about anything.

CERSEI: I will not hear it, not from you.

TYRION: (starts)

CERSEI: I will not hear it!

TYRION: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.

CERSEI pauses.

TYRION: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father

The MOUNTAIN readies to draw his sword. CERSEI sighs and sits back, eyes closed. The MOUNTAIN stands back. TYRION pours himself some wine and drinks it down. He pours another glass, and walks back to CERSEI, placing his cup on her desk. He takes another glass..

TYRION: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.

CERSEI: I will not

TYRION:  I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.

TYRION pours himself wine and takes a drink.

CERSEI: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.

TYRION: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?

CERSEI: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.

TYRION: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.

CERSEI: What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen

TYRION: Mm, not like this.

CERSEI: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.

TYRION: Yes.

CERSEI: Why?

TYRION: Because I think she will make the world a better place.

CERSEI: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

TYRION: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.

CERSEI: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.

CERSEI cradles her belly and TYRION notices. She takes a deep breath.

CERSEI: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter

TYRION: You're pregnant.

CERSEI does not answer.

CUT TO: Side Area of the Dragon Pit

JON picks up some bleached bones from the dirt floor. DAENERYS approaches him.

JON: No one is less happy about this than I am.

DAENERYS: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.

DAENERYS takes the bone from JON.

DAENERYS: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.

She hands the bone back to JON.

JON: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.

DAENERYS: I can't have children.

JON: Who told you that?

DAENERYS: The witchwho murdered my husband

JON: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?

DAENERYS: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.

JON: So, what now?

DAENERYS: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.

JON: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.

DAENERYS: (Laughs)

They hear footsteps, and they walk back to the others. The camera shifts to the main area of the Dragon Pit. TYRION walks in alone. He is followed by CERSEI, the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, JAIME and the Lannister guards. The northern delegation watches as they approach the dais.

CERSEI: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.

CUT TO: The North

A raven flies in the wintery night towards Winterfell.

CUT TO: Winterfell interior

LITTLEFINGER: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.

SANSA: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?

LITTLEFINGER: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.

SANSA: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.

LITTLEFINGER: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.

SANSA: What does that have to do with anything?

LITTLEFINGER: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.

SANSA: You think he wants to marry her?

LITTLEFINGER: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King

SANSA: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.

LITTLEFINGER: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister

SANSA: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

LITTLEFINGER: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.

SANSA: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?

LITTLEFINGER: She's your sister

SANSA: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.

LITTLEFINGER: Why did she come to Winterfell?

SANSA: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.

LITTLEFINGER: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?

SANSA: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.

LITTLEFINGER: And after she murders you, what does she become?

SANSA: Lady

SANSA contemplates.

CUT TO: Dragonstone Map Room

JON, DAENERYS, DAVOS, JORAH, THEON, VARYS, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM and TYRION strategize.

JON: If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.

DAENERYS: And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.

JORAH: Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror

JON: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.

DAENERYS: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.

CUT TO: Dragonstone Throne Room

JON and DAVOS walk through the room, away from the meeting. THEON trails behind.

THEON: Jon.

JON and DAVOS stop and turn.

THEON: Can I speak with you?

JON: All right.

DAVOS exits.

THEON: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.

JON: We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.

THEON: You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.

JON: It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.

THEON: Not compared to me, you haven't.

JON: No. Not compared to you.

THEON: I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.

JON: Our fatherwas more of a father

THEON: He was.

JON: And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.

THEON: I did.

JON: (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.

THEON: But the things I've done

JON: It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.

THEON: When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now.

JON: So, why are you still talking to me?

JON exits.

CUT TO: The shores of King's Landing

HARRAG and the ironborn load their skiffs, preparing to depart.

HARRAG: Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in.

THEON approaches

THEON: All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.

HARRAG: Your sister

THEON:  She's not dead.

HARRAG:  She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.

THEON: She's our queen

HARRAG: She's your sister

THEON: I did. I ran from my uncle

HARRAG: So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.

THEON:  We're done with all that.

HARRAG: Who says we are?

THEON: Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.

HARRAG spits in THEON's face. The men laugh.

HARRAG: Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best.

MAN: He needs to shut his mouth.

HARRAG swings a strong blow to THEON's chin. THEON reels, but recovers to throw a counter-punch. HARRAG evades the blow, they grapple and THEON is thrown to the ground.

MAN: Hey!

The ironborn are enjoying the fight. THEON gets up and the grapple, before HARRAG lands a headbutt. Followed by a leveling punch to the face.

MAN #2: Oh, yes!

MAN #3: That's more like it.

THEON charges, grabbing HARRAG around the waist. But HARRAG gets the better of him, and THEON ends up back on the sand, bloodied.

HARRAG: Stay down or I'll kill you!

THEON gets up, woozy. HARRAG punches him again, and he crumbles to the sand, groaning.

HARRAG: (panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!

THEON gets up again, and they set on one another. HARRAG knees THEON in the groin, but there is no reaction. He does it again. THEON is emboldened. He headbutts HARRAG, then tackles him. He sits astride HARRAG and delivers repeated, punishing blows to his bloodied face. HARRAG is defeated.

THEON: Not for me. For Yara!

MEN: Yara!

THEON staggers to the water, and he cleanses his face.

CUT TO: King's Landing Exterior

Sansa contemplates the landscape on a grey, snowy day from the ramparts of Winterfell. She makes up her mind and walks towards a guard.

SANSA: Have my sister

CUT TO: The Great Hall of Winterfell

SANSA and BRAN sit at the great table, with WOLKAN standing to the side. The room is filled with northmen. The guards escort ARYA into the hall, and leave her standing alone in front of the table. ARYA looks around and spies YOHN ROYCE, then LITTLEFINGER.

ARYA: Are you sure you want to do this?

SANSA: It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.

ARYA: And what does honor demand?

SANSA: That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.

ARYA: All right, then. Get on with it.

SANSA: You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?

SANSA and ARYA turn their heads towards LITTLEFINGER, as do the others in the room. LITTLEFINGER is dumbfounded.

ARYA: My sister

LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.

SANSA: Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?

LITTLEFINGER: I did it to protect you.

SANSA: You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon

LITTLEFINGER: Whatever your aunt

SANSA: You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon

LITTLEFINGER: I know of no such letter.

SANSA: You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father

LITTLEFINGER: I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.

BRAN: You held a knife to his throat.

LITTLEFINGER turns to face BRAN, surprised at this knowledge he has.

BRAN: You said, "I did warn you not the trust me."

ARYA: You told our mother

ARYA draws the knife.

LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.

SANSA: Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?

LITTLEFINGER: If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.

SANSA: Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother

LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, please.

SANSA: I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.

LITTLEFINGER: Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.

SANSA: (Nods.)

LITTLEFINGER: I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.

JOHN ROYCE: I think not.

LITTLEFINGER kneels before SANSA.

LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.

SANSA: And yet, you betrayed her.

LITTLEFINGER: I loved you. More than anyone.

SANSA: And yet, you betrayed me.

SANSA rises.

SANSA: When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.

ARYA steps briskly towards LITTLEFINGER, and slashes his throat with his own knife, swiftly.

LITTLEFINGER: Sansa! (GASPS) I--

ARYA returns tableside, and everyone watches as LITTLEFINGER dies.

CUT TO: An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.

Jaime paces into the yard. CERSEI watches from the upper level.

JAIME: Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.

MAN: It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.

JAIME: We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.

CERSEI: Ser Jaime.

JAIME: Your Grace.

The lords bow in union to CERSEI

CERSEI: My lords, I need a moment with my brother

MEN: Your Grace.

JAIME dismisses them and the lords exit. CERSEI walks down to ground level to join him.

CERSEI: What are you doing?

JAIME: Preparing the expedition north.

CERSEI: Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?

JAIME: You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy

CERSEI: I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the manwho murdered our father

JAIME: You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

CERSEI: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?

JAIME: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!

CERSEI: And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boyand his new queen

JAIME: I made a promise.

CERSEI: Our child will rule Westeros.

JAIME: Our child will never be born if the dead come south.

CERSEI: The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.

JAIME: And then what?

CERSEI: And then we rule.

JAIME: When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!

CERSEI: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.

JAIME: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.

CERSEI: How many dragons did you see at the pit?

JAIME: Two.

CERSEI: What happened to the third?

JAIME: For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!

CERSEI: She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.

JAIME: We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!

CERSEI: No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father

JAIME: The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?

CERSEI: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen

JAIME: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander

CERSEI: And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our fatherwithout telling me, your queen

JAIME: I didn't conspire with him.

CERSEI: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.

JAIME: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.

CERSEI: And that will be treason.

JAIME: Treason?

CERSEI: Disobeying your queen

JAIME: Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

JAIME starts to exit, but he is blocked by the MOUNTAIN.

CERSEI: I told you no one walks away from me.

JAIME: Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father

CERSEI:  There's one more yet to come.

JAIME: Give the order, then.

CERSEI hesitates, and JAIME thinks that he has called her bluff. Then CERSEI nods to the MOUNTAIN, who unsheathes his sword. JAIME looks nervous, then makes up his mind.

JAIME: I  don't believe you.

JAIME moves past the MOUNTAIN, who lets him go. CERSEI starts after him, but lets him go.

CUT TO: Outside King's Landing.

JAIME rides his horse away from KIng's Landing. He inspects his golden hand, then fits his glove over it. He looks up into the grey day, as snow flurries come down. He rides off.

CUT TO: Montage of King's Landing at night.

CUT TO: Winterfell Interior

BRAN sits by the fire. There is a knocking on the door.

BRAN: Come in.

SAM enters.

BRAN: Samwell Tarly.

SAM: I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

BRAN: I remember everything.

Sam closes the door.

BRAN: You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.

SAM: Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?

BRAN: I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

SAM: Oh! I don't know what that means.

BRAN: I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?

SAM: Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.

BRAN: He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this  in a vision?

BRAN holds up a scroll delivered by a raven.

SAM: Oh.

BRAN: He needs to know the truth.

SAM: The truth about what?

BRAN: About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my fatherson He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt

SAM: It's not.

BRAN: Dornish bastards are named Sand.

SAM: At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.

BRAN: Are you certain?

SAM:  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?

CUT TO: Flashback

BRAN observes the wedding of RHAEGAR and LYANNA.

RHAEGAR:  Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.

LYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.

BRAN: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt

RHAEGAR and LYANNA kiss.

CUT TO: Boat interior

JON knocks on a door and DAENERYS answers.

BRAN: He loved her. And she loved him.

DAENERYS lowers her arm to invite JON in. The door closes. TYRION watches from the hall.

CUT TO: Flashback

LYANNA has given birth to JON, but she is dying. NED kneels beside her, holding her hand.

BRAN: And Jon -  Jon's real name

LYANNA: His name is Aegon

CUT TO: Boat Interior

DAENERYS and JON are making love on her bed, passionately.

BRAN: He's never been a bastard

TYRION continues to stand in the hallway outside their door.

BRAN'S VOICE: He needs to know. We need to tell him.

CUT TO: Winterfell Exterior

SANSA and ARYA stand on the ramparts.

ARYA: Are you all right?

SANSA: It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.

ARYA: You did the right thing.

SANSA: You did it.

ARYA: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady

SANSA: Does that bother you?

ARYA: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.

SANSA: You would have. You're the strongest person I know.

ARYA: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

SANSA: Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.

ARYA: "In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."

SANSA: Father

ARYA: I miss him.

SANSA: Me, too.

CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD OF WINTERFELL.

BRAN sits in front of the godswood.

CUT TO: The Wall.

Ravens caw as Tormund and Beric patrol on the top of the wall. They look out towards the North.

BERIC: It's a long way down.

TORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

Figures start to emerge from the forrest.

MAN: I can see movement Watch, on the tree line!

MAN #2: What is it?

A huge undead army emerges from the trees. The white walkers are mounted, holding a spear. Dark clouds swirl. A horn blares as the undead army gets closer to the wall. The undead army stops, and all is still.

Atop the wall, TORMUND and BERIC look out nervouslh. A dragon's screech comes from the darkness. The undead Viserion flies in, and spits out blue flame at the wall as he passes. TORMUND and BERIC stare in disbelief. The Night King rides astride the undead dragon. TORMUND and BERIC hurry down from the watchtower.

TORMUND: Come on!  Run! Run!

The Night's Watchmen flee as the undead dragon attacks the wall will blue flame. The wall begins to buckle and fall. The stairways shake and fall apart. Many fall to their deaths. The undead army watches, motionless. TORMUND and BERIC just escape from the collapsing section of the wall. Once it has come to the ground, the undead army starts to advance. The army seems endless, and includes undead giants. The Night King leads from above, riding Viserion. The undead march south of the wall.
